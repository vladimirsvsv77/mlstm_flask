0, just the home version of norton internet / av has too many glitches and problems to even remotely bother with .
0, the cons are n't really a big deal to me ... except one con that does annoy me is the way it stores files ... no folder structure ... and it 's based on the title of the songs ... many of my songs where seperated into folders ( on the pc ) ... and a few had same titles ... so i had to change the titles to make sure that i did n't have any that might be the same as another . 
0, unfortunately  the 6610 does not offer voice dialing like my previous phone  but the other features it packs outweighs this shortcoming . 
1, 5 . the price is right .
0, the eax sound enhancement feature did n't do enough for me and the custom eq was a limited 5 band eq . 
0, because steve jobs is a twisted individual and he made sure that he ruined this device by giving it an unreplacable 18 month battery .
1, ying to point out they have experience  and so the reliability of the connection you get is among the best .
1, the auto-focus performs well  but i love having the 12 optional scene modes - they are dummy-proof  and correspond to many situations in which i would actually seek to use the camera . 
1, the zennx will keep running for the price of a replacement battery  just like any other battery-powered appliance . 
1, fm tuner & microphone : having a tuner in the player is a blessing .

0, as mentioned in other reviews the headphones are useless and need to be replaced right away ! 
1, they are razor sharp  the color balance is perfect  and the focus is great .
0, there was neither picture nor sound . 
1, this phone is one of the few phones that have an fm radio tuner built in . 
1, the power  low noise operation  and speed control makes up for the problems i have experienced .
1, the touchpad is great once you get used to it  and i much prefer it to standard buttons or scroll wheels ( as on the dell dj for example ) .
1, if you are just looking for something to keep with you at all times  then this is a great camera choice .
1, and bluetooth does not drain the battery as quick as i thought it would  i usually can go 1.5 days with bluetooth on along with making calls before i need a full recharge .
1, firewire & usb2.0-- for those fortunate enough to have firewire400  your in for a real treat with autosync .
1, combine this with the excellent price we got in the gold box  and i 'm really happy .
0, the major reasons i didn 't give it a five are : one  i didn 't think the fine adjustment worked well .
1, the software that comes with it is amazing and the online service that comes free is really very neat. clean clear and well focused on over 95 % of all photos taken by a beginner . 
0, i am seriously considering purchasing another wrench and just not using the " sliding wrench " which comes on the router .
1, this router does everything that it is supposed to do  so i dont really know how to talk that bad about it .
1, i can highly recommend this product because of its ease of use ( hardware and software )  playback quality and value for the price . 
1, while i 'm not too keen on their customer service ( none of the products i have from creative have given me issues )  i can definitely recommend the zen micro for the simple fact that it does exactly what it is supposed to do and more ... without needing any of the extra hype except word of mouth .
0, the software sucks . 
0, 1 ) quite bulky ( it 's about the same size as my minolta vectis s-1 aps slr ) and uses a heavy battery  although not very solid as it is contructed mostly of plastic ( unlike canon 's elph line ) 
1, the only free help you get is in renewing your subscription !
1, it 's cheaper  holds more songs and is smaller .
1, i like it 's shape and it 's keypad and joystick .
1, give each friend a different ringtone .
0, the achilles heel of this router is its inability to stream music  or copy large files over the local network .
1, the sound is very nice .
0, while transferring songs to the player  the interface has crashed a few times ( 4-5 times in a 4-5 hour period ) normally this would cause me major concern  but it appears that this bug is reproducible  which leads me to believe that creative will fix it with a patched version shortly ( or maybe it 's just my computer ) .
1, i never get dropped calls .
1, the price / performance looked just right . 
0, long reboots due to norton taking forever to boot .
0, the scrol bar agian takes some getting used to .
1, but this does work even if you turn off the lcd viewing -- great battery saver .
1, try before you buy if at all possible : although i am a mac addict now for over a decade and everyone i know has previously bought an ipod  the nomad zen xtra was a far better value and is just as easy to use with regards to both hardware and software interface . 
1, while this phone obviously doesn 't have the same quality construction as motorola does  the nokia 6600 is one of the better phones i 've used .
0, i have to move pictures off of it every day so i have room for more pictures the next  and i don 't have enough money to buy the 256 meg card that i 've had my eye on for a while .
0, buttons size is ok for me  my wife  but not my grany .
1, built like a tank  yet nimble enough to be comfortably used with the leigh dovetail jig .
1, the hitachi m12v is a dream to work with  smooth starts  adjustable speeds  micro-adjustable depth  and plenty of power to spare .
1, the software included is an easy installation and you have the option of using the creative software  windows media player 10  or simply windows explorer to move music back and forth between your zen touch .
1, great phone  i 'd buy another . 
1, it is small enough to fit easily in a coat pocket or purse . 
0, then my dvds would stop playing in the middle  or not even be read at all . 
1, the possibilities with auto  manual  and the very helpful " scene " mode  which offers 11 optimized situational settings like portrait  landscape  beach / snow  sunset etc.  are endless . 
0, of course  if you try to reach symantec customer service you get useless automated systems unless you want to pay $ 30 per incident .
1, i am impressed with how easy this camera is to use . 
1, i was looking for a compact  rugged ( i carry it hiking  skiing  boating  etc ) camera which is easy to use .
1, zennx 's replaceable battery was the deciding factor in my purchase of zennx over ipod . 
0, if you experience problems with installation  you can visit symantec 's website  click the support tab  click the ' home or home office support ' and there is an automated support assistant that can scan the norton program files on your computer and it will tell you what is not working right and how to fix it .
1, 3 it is very compact but the controls are so well designed that they 're still easy to use . 
1, my opion is concentrate on what you need now  this product has exelent range  holds a teady connection  hasent even droped one and i have it for more than a month now .
0, the included earbuds were uncomfortable . 
0, this simple nuance was too much for nokia  and they still refuse to acknoledge the fact that their technician could have broken the phone or repair the phone for free .
0, in short - nokia themselves don 't know that this phone doesn 't work with the palm  and if you don 't heed my advice you will spend hours with technicians around the globe reading from scripts  chiding you in broken english for not following their directions exactly .
0, i occassionally flip songs while working out as i accidently hit the pad even lightly ( yes i have it in maximum desensitized mode ) .
1, if compact size is your highest priority in a 2-megapixel camera  the canon powershot s100 digital elph is a standout choice and aptly named for its diminutive design .
0, i thought given all the " 10 " reviews about this camera that i would buy it in spite of being a bit pricey .
1, the battery life is very good  i got about 90 minutes with the lcd turned on all the time  the first time around  and i have been using it with the lcd off every now and then  and have yet needed to recharge it . 
1, i have really enjoyed the camera on this phone .
1, the pictures are beautiful  and the camera is so small you can carry it anywhere .
0, it takes a while to learn how to use it right  and at this point i am able to make about 70 % of my calls using it .
0, one bad thing is that it comes with a pitiful 32mb compactflash card  and for most purposes  it is not enough . 
1, i love the camera .
0, b ) the screen is hard to read -- the cover hides it an already annoying poorly lit display 
1, this is my first digital camera and i could n't be happier . 
1, i like the speed control .
1, i think it 's great .
0, at the very least  a sturdier more protective carrying case would be nice . 
1, the lens retracts and has its own metal cover so you don 't need to fuss with a lens cap .
1, and the biggest plus is that you don 't have to buy any expensive refills .
1, the router has plenty of power for any type of bit or wood i need to cut  and the speed control knob is easy to get to .
1, i needed three batteries to keep myself going with the s330  but the battery in the g3 is a real powerhouse : 
1, decent battery-- on the average size  but the 40gb comes with a dock .
1, there is no comparison  the chanp is easy and smell free  the genie was difficult to use one handed ( which is absolutly vital if you have a little one on a changing pad ) and there was a deffinite odor eminating from the genie plus we found that the quick tie garbage bags where the ties are integrated into the bag work really well because there isn 't any added bulk around the sealing edge of the champ .
1, i 'm glad canon decided to keep the 4mp resolution and improved upon it with new technology ; 
1, i love my new nomad  its great ! 
1, remote : you can stand it on end ( harder to lose )  and it 's far better designed than the 1100s . 
1, i like my phones to be small so i can fit it in my pockets . 
1, in a word  " awesome " is how i would describe this camera . 
1, newbies will find the full auto setting will give them perfect pictures right out of the box .

1, audio is mono and fairly acceptable  quiet also with little distortions .
1, the size is tiny  which i love .
0, nothing spectacular is done by internet security or by antivirus software .
1, it contains the smell from our baby 's diapers and we can use just about any kind of bag inside .
0, 5 . the zen does not have a stop button ! 
1, this is probably one of the few dvd players at $ 40 that can play almost everything you throw at it . 
1, easy to use  small form factor  and looks good to boot . 
0, my only significant complaint is sound quality . 
0, it wo n't play all of my movies . 
1, it is very easy to change bits without removing the router from the table and the shaft lock works great .
0, the opening could be a little wider  i suppose  but i haven 't really seen anything else that could be improved .
0, is not as intuitive as i would like .
1, we just buy the smaller bags that come like 250 to a roll and are sented and they are like $ 6.00 and they work great .

1, 5 ) its focusing system is also very flexible . 
1, drops and strong signals even from the backyard .
1, this holds alot and does not take up alot of space .
1, - speakerphone 
1, but for what i do use it is perfect . 
0, it is embarassing getting phone calls from family members telling you that the dvd player you gave them less that 3 months ago is no longer working . 
1, however  there is a more detailed pdf manual on the cd ( and online ) that should answer any questions about the operational features of the zen micro .
0, the reason i rated it a four is because of that darn diopter adjustment dial. its very small and hard to turn so you can 't get an accurate adjustment ( for those of you who do n't know what a diopter adjustment is  it is to adjust the focus of the viewfinder to your eyesight . ) 
1, if i had to do it over  i wouldn 't buy anything else .
0, as a windows user  i had to install the software including drivers and itunes on my desktop  and this is the only area where i encountered a nuisance .
1, i bought it for my trip to beunos aires  and also used it at the iguazu falls  and could not have asked for more perfect performance ! 
0, the best thing to do with this version  is to leave it on the store shelf . it doesn 't work  and will cost you an enormous amount of your time  not to mention your hard earned dollars .
0, the 6610 has the radio function which is utterly useless . 
0, once again it won 't reinstall  even with online and email assistance from symantect technicians .
1, well  it was nice while it lasted . 
1, i 'm in high school  and this camera is perfect for what i use it for  carrying it around in my pocket so i can take pictures whenever i want to  of my friends and of funny things that happen .
1, i love this player . 
1, this is the best camera you can have for digital images if you want to :
1, for the first few weeks  this player was everything i expected it to be  an affordable multi-format dvd player with a stylish slim case as advertised . 
1, amazon was wonderful about picking it up the next day and paying for the return shipping . 
1, the included leather pouch is a big plus : it actually protects the unit well  something a lot of ' carrying cases ' fail to do with other audio devices . 
1, pros the design is very nice  and the colors are too .
1, the height adjustment works well- not perfect .
1, if you on the other hand always use automatic settings ( and not manual ) you should be just fine  as the camera features some of the best automatic settings i have ever seen .
0, the only con i can think of is the lack of a mega-pixel camera .
1, overall an excellent phone . 
0, after 10 years  i now downloaded mccaffee 's product after calling their support .... they answered quickly  and for free  and were very helpful .
1, everything else about the ipod is great  the click wheel is very easy to use and so is the software that comes with it .
1, i received this little jewel as a gift and i can honestly say iabsolutely love it .
0, battery : compared to the other players on the market  the ipod has one of the worst batteries around .
1, the keys are laid out normal so there is no guessing . 
0, less than a month later the screen freezes and eventually shows " no disc . " 
0, although i find it more convenient to use 1-touch dialing  this phone does not have voice dialing . 
0, they didn 't know what the problem could be .
1, i use the router with a 3 1 / 2in raised panel bit with no problems .
0, 4 ) no fm or voice recording - these would have been nice extras . 
1, the person on the other end of the call can hear you perfectly . 
0, first thing i noticed was that the creative wasn 't well made .
0, but not good enough for me .
1, i could make phone calls from locations i previously could not ( like my apartment ) . 
0, 3 ) with mediasource being so easy  i found no use for the bundled nomad explorer software . 
0, if there were any complaints i have  they are marginal  but one is apples ' properietary set-up for music files  their incompatibility with other music services ( i.e. napster ) is down right wrong .
1, it is far better than just a trash can or the diaper genie and it 's fairly inexpensive as baby products go !
0, also  some other mp3 players such as the nitrus allow you to play wma ( windows media audio ) files  whereas the ipod does not .
1, it took me about an hour to set up a wireless environment in her townhouse and she hasn 't called me yet with any problems .
1, i am very pleased with my purchase .
1, on the whole  i 'm quite happy with the purchase .
1, it has several play options  one of the best is an option to shuffle  based on all or a certain playlist . 
1, this camera is so light and tiny that i literally carry it everywhere with me  which is great considering i 'm an artist and like to capture interesting items for future painting .
0, the auto-focus on the camera seems to have trouble focusing on the subject .
1, so far i have used all of the above-mentioned features  and find them well designed  and easy to understand .
0, but this doesn 't make up for it 's innumerable other short-comings  the biggest of which is the inability to download any updates due to problems with liveupdate .
1, overall though  i 'm very happy with it and highly recommend it to folks looking for a mp3 player  even if it is to pretend your not a braindead consumer giving into the marketing hype of the ipod . ; )
1, it 's worth it . 
1, compared to other leading hdd mp3 players  the value per gb is the tops . 
1, i 've had a lot of cameras  but this one is actually being used  and not stored in a desk : it 's allways in my shist pocket .
0, yeah - this program protects your computer all right - by locking you off the internet .
1, also  you have to use it with itunes - or they 'll sue  dammit ! but itunes is about as good as anything .
0, norton support is completely pathetic .
1, you do get 1 more gb than an ipod mini .
0, the zooming lever is shaky  i hope it does not operate mechanically  otherwise you 'll feel uneasy . 
1, the sound quality is fantastic ( cd quality ) and it is really great to carry this around instead of stacks of cd 's or tapes ! 
1, the service from the supplier was exceptional . 
1, i got it to use with the new $ 5-per-month service from yahoo ( music unlimited  ) and despite the above issues  i love it .
1, the back of the player is nice too  with water ripples inside the clear white coating .
0, a ) feel cheap -- the plastic is feels like it would break very easily  and it definately wouldnt survive a drop

1, it holds a lot of diapers  not to mention the odor !
1, this camera is perfect for the person who wants a compact camera that produces excellent photos in just about any situation .
1, the moveable lcd screen is great . 
1, at double-speed ( 2x forward speed )  it still plays mp3s with sound -- they are pitch-corrected and smooth  but twice as fast ! 
0, bluetooth does not work on this phone .
1, especially for the price amazon gives it at ( i was unable to get mine through amazon due to some credit complications ) .
0, the headphones are not very comfortable  but most people have a certain style they like so just go buy new ones or keep the ones you have .
0, it could be a little bit bigger  but it 's easy to get used to . 
1, ) the zen micro appears sturdy and well constructed  hefty  if you will  far better than many of its competitors . .
0, like most of their solutions ( which first blame other applications for errors )  the tech persons line was that this was probably a microsoft error - it was not .
1, overall the phones fantastic  and i would have given it 5 stars  but its not perfect .
0, the explorer program did shut down a couple times while i was renaming titles and changing genres but i did n't have to reboot the computer or anything  just open up explorer again . 
1, the resolution is very good and the colors are bright and even changeable ! 
1, in summary  i love this camera and would whole-heartedly recommend this to anyone wanting a high quality point and shoot camera in the medium price range . 
1, the eax mode that keeps the volume at the same level for any song will come in handy when i take my holiday plane rides . 
0, my daughter is only 4 months old and we do notice an odor .
0, since i received the phone  i spent countless hours on the phone with customer service reps who promised t-zones would work " in 24 hours " . 
1, i am enjoying my phone a lot .... 
0, i know this unit will have problems in the future and the $ 40 for the 2 year " no questions asked " replacement warranty will be worth it  since creative will only warrant it for 90 days - which in itself is totally ridiculous ! 
1, having done all this  i was quite pleased to see that all corners i needed were decently covered by the signal .
1, creative has excellent music software  a very responsive tech support group ( they are quick on firmware updates  and make them publicly available )  and usually a good array of accessories .
1, 7 . have a good chunk of my small mp3 to listen through the speaker phone .
0, ( ... ) like most soho routers  it has nearly non-existant logging .

1, the nokia 6600 is a great phone  good games  good camera .

1, this is the best purchase i 've made in a very long time .
0, the gprs web access is sloooooooooooooow !
0, even when i set it to low  it 's still very hard for me to adjust the player to where and what i want it to do .
1, has the click wheel and the ability to scan through thousnds of songs and organizes them great .
0, after telling the rep and his tech supervisor the problem the only answer was to uninstall the program ( which i had already done ) ...
1, this is really a nice diaper pail .
1, and so far  i have been very  very happy with my zen micro .
0, i tried disabling the various components provided with this product  paring it all the way back to anti-virus only service ... and saw no improvement .
0, i 've also had the nomad zen lock-up several times . 
1, i love the bluetooth ; easy to use with a wireless jabra headset .

1, if you have to buy a camera on a buget this has got to be the one . 
0, i added a crank for those times when i need to make fine adjustments  but i seldom use it .
1, way to go apple !
1, exposure compensation in 1 / 3 stop increments ( i leave it set on + 1 / 3 stop to brighten up the default exposure  which goes a bit dark for my taste ) .
1, since then  i have not found one major problem with it .
0, the box included a little polyester  pull-string bag  ( yes  you read right a bag  something a boy would carry ten marbles in ) and tries to pass it off as the case .
0, i also own a canon digital rebel and i agree that the advanced controls on the sd500 are not as robust  but overall picture quality goes head-to-head with the digital rebel .
0, ( it had locked up multiple times previously  but always managed to work afterwards ) this time  the touch screen wouldn 't respond to me and none of the buttons worked .
1, everything else about the camera is great . 
1, and so far  i 've been very pleased . 
0, a lot of " fragments " were left in the registry  and it the norton system folders .
1, this is my first digital camera  and what a ' toy ' it is ! 
0, difficult navigation - i wo n't necessarily say " difficult  " but i do n't enjoy the scrollwheel to navigate . 
0, software definitely sucks  hangs up my notebook about half the time  but i do n't mind buying notmad . 
1, the ss body is wonderful  feels high-quality .
0, the scroll bar problems make the task of creating playlists more frustrating . 
1, i 've only had it a week  but so far  everything about this camera is making me happy . 
0, overall  it does its basic function very well  but we expect more from the mp3 players today and the zen micro does not rise to the occassion .
1, the menu allows you to search for files by artist  genre  and album quite easily . 
0, shortly after i brought it  the plunging shafts started sticking .
1, before you run out and buy an ipod  understand something : there are reasons the zen is worth encountering this kind of hassle  principally excellent ( for mp3 ) sound quality .
1, because it can help a so-so photographer take spectacular photos ! 
1, as a whole  the dvd player has a sleek design and works fine . 
1, great colors  pictures and white balance . 
1, overall the ipod really is an almost flawless beast . the capacity in the 20 gb is more than i think most people would ever need and  for the price  i highly recommend it .
0, when i tried to install the second dvd player in my brothers house  that one didn " t work either ! 
1, it is mindless to operate .
0, mediasource did not recognize my tags ! 
1, i find that it is stable in my hands and its ' weight actually contributes to that stability .
0, it 's not the heaviest around ( i think porter-cable has that distinction )  but i found its combination of weight and power really too much to allow precise handheld operation .
0, during install  nis would either freeze or not reboot properly when asked to do so .
1, it sits in the corner of our bathroom and we have never had any problems with odors at all ( and we live in the damp and humid south  where odors of all kinds are generally rife ) .
1, they fix the problem and help you with whatever your i-pod needs comes with two usb ports and a charger .
0, the only thing i don 't like about it is that you have to buy a larger memory card  first thing !
1, overall  if you know what basic steps to take  it was not difficult to connect  and the s / w worked well to connect .
0, the depth adjustment was sloppy .
1, i had a sony ericsson t610 before this and the t610 is far inferior .
1, i was worried that 4 megapixel photos would download more slowly  but there 's no difference in working with the files . 
1, i just bought this player today and i already love it . 
1, camera quality isn 't bad for the low resolution .
0, 1 ) fragile ( i broke the 1st one within 10 days ) 
1, the smooth operation variable speed and a set of good jasada bits will provide just the right combination for great predictable results .
1, i 've had nothing but good luck with t-mobile .
0, es  the interface took a little getting used to  but once i did  it 's almost second nature now .
0, this isn 't uncommon in cameras  though  just as long as you bring your charger and spare batteries  you should be fine .
0, regarding pc software support nokia suite does not work with some versions of xp as i tried to connect my phone via infrared port on my laptop . 
0, so i took out the battery and put it back in again  only to find that it would not work .
1, there are so many functions in this little  yet powerful camera ! 
1, picture quality in outdoor settings is indistinguishable from 35mm . 
1, to keep it short  this is cheaper  and in my opinion a better choice than an ipod . 
1, there were a few attractive features  such as the small size and the layout of the remote . 
1, yes  the 1-800 number probably redirected me to someone in india  but the guy was easy to understand  and he helped solve the problem .
1, i highly recommend this phone to anyone . 
1, 3 . the remote capture and fileviewer software bundled for photo capture is mind-blowing . 
1, i love this player and would probably go with creative labs again . 
1, fortunately for me  i have yet to have a single problem with this player .
0, the scroll wheel is finicky ; it works most of the time but there is a learning curve for pressing it just right ; new users say they have 50 % - 75 % success rate ; some find it so frustrating that they just return the device . 
0, - the battery life leaves a lot to be desired .
1, i took it to my father 's house to play a tom jones concert dvd and he loved the player so much i gave it to him . 
1, update : the finish is more " mirror " than silver -- and i like it ! 
0, a larger memory card and extra battery are good things to buy .
1, the reception and sound quality are top-notch . 
0, even the " shorter " battery life  though  has not impaired my positive experience with the zen micro in any way .
1, but you can download some really good ones like pac-man or mafia wars .
0, the only other problem was that security for the wireless connection .
1, the ipod is a fine cousin to the early macs and current offerings from jobs and company .
1, audio is excellent . 
1, a sony ericcson may be the phone for you ... but good luck finding one w / all the features & such a competitive price .
0, the battery power discharges rapidly especially on using the web browser .
0, i will also say that it takes a very long moment for the camera to do its digital image processing between the time you press the button and when the camera actually takes the picture .
1, this is the first phone i know of that has the large bright screen  infrared  bluetooth  usb connector and a speakerphone .
1, the apex 2600 has been a steady performer for me . 
1, since batteries do run out on everything  this will also be a big money-saver since ipods  irivers  rca  dell  all have built-in batteries that need to be replaced by a technician ( apple charges 100 bones for the battery replacement ) . 
0, navigation could be better  but there is n't really anything the zen xtra can 't do once you 've gotten comfortable with it .
