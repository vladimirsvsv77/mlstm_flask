1, the wrt54g plus the hga7t is a perfect solution if you need wireless coverage in a wider area or for a hard-walled house as was my case .
0, i dont especially like how music files are unstructured ; basically they are just dumped into one folder with no organization  like you might have in windows explorer folders and subfolders .
1, i was using the cheapie pail ... and it worked ok until the opening device fell apart .
1, you can manage your profile  change the contrast of backlight  make different type of display  either list or tabbed .

1, from the internet  woodworking books  local stores and personal opinions the hitachi m12v 3-1 / 4 hp router time and time again came up to be the router of choice or best for its price .
1, i loved this product when i first got it - great sound  easy to use ( even though i agree that the software was n't the best ) and held enough songs to suit any mood .

0, i replaced it with a router raizer and it works much better .
1, it 's being used daily and i have had none of the problems reported by other reviewers ( headphone jack  player locking up  etc ) .
1, the software has been installed on windows 95  98  2000 and xp and i haven 't had any problems with it .
1, another thing i like about this camera is the way that you can swap colors around and the impressive video quality i would advise any person in the market for a camera to pay the little extra on the hefty $ 500 price tag and get a quality camera .
1, it looks very cool  and seems quite small to me and very light . 
0, one little minor flaw with this camera is that the lens is visible in the viewfinder  but does not detract from the image at all . 
0, i 've had this thing just over a month and the headphone jack has already come loose . 
0, do n't buy this player . 
0, size - bigger than the ipod 
0, the creative mediasource software that comes with the zen micro is cluttered  and excludes my favorite feature in itunes  the ability to automatically copy everything you import into a certain folder .
1, considering the price and specs  this might be the best buy out there for a large memory mp3 player . 
0, the grain was terrible . 
0, another problem i had with this camera was the zoom function .
1, bottom line : if you value excellent sound quality and the ability to use music subscription services  and are willing to deal with the possibility ( not the certainty ) of setup gremlins  by all means get the zen micro .
1, this camera is great  wonderfully small  and has attactive hi-tech casing .
0, i know the saying is " you get what you pay for " but at this stage of game dvd players must have better quality than this - there is no excuse .

1, the prints are beautiful ! 
1, finding all the albums  songs etc is much easier than you would think it would be even if you have 20 gig ( well 18 gig ) worth of music .
1, what makes the focus-lock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f8 . 
0, however  the calls constantly drop in my area and i experince mega-static  to the point where i 'd have to dial numbers 6-7 times to get a clear line . 
1, just want a wireless router for home or your very small business  you can just get a wrt54g from here and configure it .
1, what i really like about- its quite  it can handle my workload and it was so cheap that i can throw it away and buy another one without blinking .
1, i just received my 40gb zen xtra yesterday and i 'm extremely pleased with it . 
1, it makes the nomad i purchase feel and look like junk .
1, i have had the phone for 1 week  the signal quality has been great in the detroit area ( suburbs ) and in my recent road trip between detroit and northern kentucky ( cincinnati ) i experienced perfect signal and reception along i-75  far superior to at &#38; t 's which does not work along several long stretches on that same route . 
1, the screen is large and bright and has all the info i need where i need it . 
0, sometimes a suite is not a good deal and all you get is a bundle of headaches .
0, whatever ... on to the negatives : -touchy about charging ... you can damage the battery and seriously decrease it 's life if you don 't upgrade the firmware or dont ' heed the advice to always plug in the player side of the cord before plugging in the outlet side .
1, it has a classic design yet looks hip . 
1, sound : this is where i love zen the most .
1, i 'm not gonna go into the features cause if you 're reading this review  you 've probably already looked at them  but i must say the dj feature if very cool and the removable battery is also a bonus !
1, like it 's predecessor  the quickly revised nx  this player boasts a decent size and weight  a relatively-intuitive navigational system that categorizes based on id3 tags  and excellent sound ( widely known to be better than ipod - not surprising considering the number of years creative has been in the audio peripheral business ) . 
1, canon have packed a lot in here and the options and controls are easy to use and logically laid out . 
1, seems to work great .

1, you do not have to waste money or time trying to purchase special bags for the champ .
1, another reason i got it is because you can put wma files on it . 
0, the photos in the address book are terribly scaled too ; they look as though they were built out of legos .
1, i am just in love with this phone  especially after using a more primitve phone about 3 years .
1, the instruction manuals and documentation are excellent so that the learning curve will be much less steep .
1, i also like the lock feature  so it makes the touch pad inactive .
1, no smell  easy to use with one hand free  and best of all it uses regular tall kitchen garbage bags so you don 't get suckered in to using only the bags made for the pail that are imposible to find !
1, get it  it 's woth every penny ! ! 
0, e ) the case is too small -- it took me like a half hour just to get this monstrosity to fit in its cage 
0, essentially  the cd included with the package is  for the most part  worthless .
1, recent price drops have made the g3 the best bargain in digital cameras currently available . 
0, from day one  we 've had hangups  crashes  glitches  continual reboots  long shutdowns due to " ccapp.exe " program running which is a norton program .
0, the strap is horrible and gets in the way of parts of the camera you need access to . 
1, you can use the player to store your computer data files ( good feature to have ) .
0, in noisy environment  it 's hard to hear from the earpiece .
0, the player hangs up on file transfer every once-in-a-while  prompting a reset . 
0, nice machines  but i consider their quality pretty low now . 
1, you of course have some good customization options with the unit as well ( sound presets  navigating options  playlists  etc ) . 
0, the only complaint i have is that the 1 / 4 " collet will not sufficiently hold any of my 1 / 4 " bits .
0, rather than creating a directory for bookmarks to be found in one area  the user must actually find the track where the bookmark was made . . 
1, the canon g3 is perhaps the best 4mp camera out there . 
1, the interface is simple to use .
1, interface - practically seamless . 
1, most of them are already switched to apex and they are happy . 
0, this phone doesn 't include phone card calling .
1, friends told me that the diaper genie did not work very well  so bought the diaper champ based on on-line reviews and i have been happy with it .
0, this is ridiculous . 
1, have had the player since xmass and love it ! 
0, this product has virtually all the same installation problems .
1, playlists can be generated on the fly ( which is a bit clunky but still a really nice bonus ) or by using the software  and there are a bevy of eq options . 
1, 4 mp gives you room for the future gaining experience ; cost offsets over time from wanting more in a camera  3x optical and the fact that it carries nikon 's quality reputation behind it make the whole package prove itself worthwile at the price . 
0, after multilple tries  one of the disks was finally recognized but video was poor and features not available . 
0, my friend has an ipod  and although the sound quality probably won 't meet most audiophile standards  the product itself is better than anything creative has made .
0, many of our disney movies do n't play on this dvd player .

1, easy to use : a lot of reviews has mentioned about this 
0, they claim to respond in a 24 hour period yet it 's been 2 weeks without a reply . 
1, at first i had a problem with some smell  then i realized if you flip the lid back and always keep the same side facing in - then there is no smell at all !
1, if you don 't mind all the buttons being touch sensitive  i 'd recomment buying it to try out  and also buy an extra 2 year warrenty for it ( there are some offered here  for about $ 15 dollors i think ) .
1, it can not be the computer or the owner  since i purchased mcafee anti-virus 8 and it installs and works fine with no problems .
1, it 's faster than wmp .
1, however since this router is backward compatible  that doesn 't pose a problem at all .
0, for my first i had a diaper genie which was not only costly with the refills but it was also very stinky .
0, after a recent update  i can no longer open more then 1 browser window .
1, the great and versatile ipod i love my ipod !
1, the scroll wheel is better than the ipod 's as well  in that you do n't risk giving yourself a cramp running your thumb around in circles endlessly - just a small nudge of the finger and you 're there . 
1, among my requirments for a phone were : good screen  decent camera  bluetooth  and gprs support .
1, diaper champ is by far the best diaper pail !
1, it 's far better than all others on the market .
0, because of this  i am disappointed and would not recommend this product .

1, its really cool . 
1, even with these shortcomings  i still think it is the best digital camera available under $ 1200 . 
1, i am very pleased with its quality and durability . 
1, i can go pretty far away from my router and still connect wirelessly .
1, it does well in all aspects of internet browsing . 
1, the two-times optical zoom operates smoothly and quietly  and lo and behold  a two-piece shutter-like cap automatically slides closed over the lens when you turn the camera off .
1, this is my second digital camera  but i 'm much more impressed with the canon s100 digital elph than i ever was with my kodak dc240 .
1, this phone is one of the best i 've ever used .
1, eball metaphor : i was hoping creative hit a home run here  and i think the zen micro is more like a stand-up double .
1, hitachi 's m12v is a big beast of a router .
1, it plays original dvds and cds and plays mp3s and jpegs . 
0, it was n't as easy to fast forward or pause a song than it was with a regular walkman . 
0, i loved it until it broke  but less than a month is not an acceptible period of time for something to work . 
1, reviews for sound quality are generally ( but not universally ) positive . 
0, the os is abit confusing at 1st  but within a few days you will pass this learning curve !
1, the speakerphone  the radio  all features work perfectly . 
0, second might be a problem i might have with my pc but not too sure  when the player is connected on the usb and i start playing on it and also using the windows explorer  it sometimes pauses by itself and tries to synchronise with the pc during play  which is a bit irritating .
1, few month ago  it 's very popular among my community .
1, there are no specail bags to deal with or buy !
1, it 's oval and ... nice .
1, the bags attach inside the champ easily and all one has to do is cram the diaper down and flip the handle .
1, finally  compare the ipod to other players on a cost / gb  and also consider ease of use .
0, the only thing i 'm concerned about is the quality / longevity of the buttons on the thing . 
0, the next problem was that it didn 't recognize all the installed components  so it would not update them  most notably and importantly  virus definitions .
1, i have not yet used all the features  like the calendar  etc  but as a music player this little thing rocks .
0, in fact  each of my creative mp3 players had software problem in the first place . 
1, no matter the format . 
0, 7 . mediasource did not install on my personal notebook . 
0, unfortunately it turns out to be the " disposable " type . 
0, the biggest problem is the installation .
1, my friends were impressed with the quality of the pictures i took !

1, this thing is great  i like to use it to pick up tough stains on my countertop and also to listen to my old 8-track records . 
1, i purchased two of these beauties .
0, luckily the soft start helped before it took the wood and tossed it or worse case  a finger .
0, i bought 2 of this model for christmas presents and neither one of them work ! 
0, my biggest complaint is the battery life or lack there of . 
1, if  like me you simply want an ipod to play your mp3 's  buy this one .
0, dont rely on t-mobile rebates .
1, the voice recorder is a beautiful add-on ; not even necessary  but just an example of why apple just wants your money and creative labs wants to make a better player .
1, other than the fact that one can 't delete a file directly from the ipod  the interface is excellent and mind-numbingly simple to use .
0, the scroll button is overly sensitive at times ; not sensitive enough at others . 
1, we really enjoyed shooting with the canon powershot sd500 .
1, but i was ready to upgrade and when i discovered that canon was going to come out with an even smaller digital camera with a higher resolution  i had to have the s100 .
1, - audio formats : supports both mp3  wma ... and yeah  wav too .
0, there are a couple things i didnt like though but nothing serious : a little larger than other mp3s but still light  the software takes some time to get used to ( maybe 10-15 mins )  and this thing would definitely be destroyed with one fall . 
1, the auto-mode is good enough for most shots but the 4300 also boasts 12 versatile scene modes as well as a manual mode though i admit i have n't played with it too much on manual . 
1, however  the ipod does not come close to the number of extra features that the ' zen micro ' has to offer .
1, the combination of the price  storage size  and player features makes this player the best on the market . 
0, many other reviewers are mentioning that they have had no problems at all > i would say that the main problem is that this player is just not made very well .
0, it feels slow to focus  and unbearably slow to shoot . 
1, i noticed that the micro adjustment knob and collet are well made and work well too .
1, overall  a good buy for the price . 
0, my jpeg pictures are viewable ( not so sharp and vivid ) on my 27 " screen but seem not as clear as when i view them on my 17 " monitor . 
1, these issues aside  the ipod is kind of like the cell phone in that once you have one  you can 't be without one .
1, first 4 months it was in our bedroom and we did not even smell any odor .
1, have had the nokia 6600 for a year now and am generally very happy with it and with t-mobile .
0, in fact  it caused my system to hang more times than not  so i uninstalled it and stuck with mediasource 100 % . 
0, my only reservations about this product concern the tagging process and the way it interacts with the software . 
1, when i took outdoor photos with plenty of light and the objects were n't moving  the photos were awesome . 
0, looks and durability : i realize many people are fond of the minimalist white interface .
0, we resorted to using small plastic bags to store the dirty diapers and dumping them in a trash can and using the diaper champ for wet diapers only .
1, builtin microphone is great for recording short voice notes .
1, but canon never fails to amaze . 
0, i am an advanced computer user  so i cannot even imagine how a new or novice user would ever get this terrible program to work !
1, it is small overall  bigger than the ipod  but keep in mind that this is because different  less expensive but not necessarily inferior technology is used in the zx . 
1, i got it working fast enough .
1, this camera is ideal for people who want more power  but do n't want to spend 1000s dollars on a camera . 
1, i 've had it for a week now  do n't regret the purchase one bit  and i never leave home without it . 
1, working for 10 hours with it on " shuffle " totally rocks ! ! 
0, even the instruction booklet is out of order .
1, if you love your cell phone games or changing your ring tones everyday  nokia beats everyone else .
1, 3660 had similar features  but that is big in size .
1, ( he had owned two apex dvd players  and was pleased with both of them . ) 
1, this router acts as a wireless access point  100 mb switch and a router making it a nice multipurpose device .
1, i think  apex is the best dvd player you can get for the price . 
1, 8 ) creative mediasource  although not as sleek looking as windows mediaplayer  is effective in organizing your collection and is linked to a good cddb service ( gracenotes ). 
1, i don 't know why cnet says there is a problem with focus  i have all my pictures sharp and high quality .
1, i 've had this phone for almost a year now and it has been nothing but great to use .
0, i would have rated it five stars but for the poor manual . 
0, i only have one complaint  and that is the 8mb card included . 
0, the cut-outs for the controls is not thought out as there is too much material in the way to adequately access the controls  especially the scroll wheel . 
0, sometimes the pictures are onthe dark side  but i 'm able to fix that using the photoshop 6.0 " adjust levels " function ... not sure how a person would do that without photoshop  though .
0, this thing is trash . 
0, the scroll bar is a bit of a pain . 
1, so far it has been very durable ( other than the little pads on the earbuds )  but those aren 't really necessary as i find them comfortable on their own .
1, after using it for about a month  i can state unequivocably that this nikon definitely delivers a huge bang for the buck . 
0, the one i purchased for a frend as a gift will not read any dvd disc . 
0, i 've searched the program and their online tech support ( worthless ) and have found no solutions .
1, great design-- very sleek and touch wheel has still never been successfully copied ( vertal ones are the only competition ) ; and now the wheel clicks  taking away a lot of headaches from 3rd gen and very navigable in the menus .
1, it 's running great for all the dvds i have and rented . 
0, the only downside to this is that it can get pretty stinky long before the pail is full .
1, 2 ) nice features  like web browser  camera  video recorder  speaker phone ( very usefully )  clear voice reception .
1, however after playing with it for three weeks now  i 'm convinced  the zen micro is superior .
0, the zen xtra will transfer the files to the player  but not the folder name . 
1, about the product : the zen micro is a sleek  stylish device that caters not just to " hip " youngsters but to people of all walks of life who like to listen on the go without having to worry frequently about battery life  size  or the " awkward " factor .
0, * scroll button more cumbersome than on earlier models . 
0, my other nit is that it didn 't include at least some kind of carrying case for everything .
0, i had a lot of problems setting it up  since the software given along with it is buggy .
0, can 't get easier than that !
1, i find the apex ad-2600 to be a great buy . 
1, i would have given this phone 5 stars if it wasn 't for the fact that i would rather use my 3330 to do all the most common things you do with a phone .
1, by the way  i use the norton 2003 corporate at work with absolutely no trouble .
1, it works well enough ( so far ) for me to be satisfied with it  and it 's possible that i 'm missing something . 
1, also included in the " games " section is the great music trivia option - which tests your skill at being able to quickly place your own songs .
1, and we still love it !
0, the door would not close . 
0, all that said  i am a little disappointed with the quality of the pictures from the camera .
1, the popup blocker and anti-spam are bonuses .

1, but it ; you won 't regret it .
1, this is an excellent router for the price .
0, on my main computer the software did not work right . 
1, the phone itself is pretty nice .
1, perhaps i bought the micro to be different  the cheaper price tag ( from amazon )  the design  or avoiding the high ipod theft in nyc subways .
0, - no propietary headset jack 
0, you must keep double checking depths .
1, you can do * so * much more with the pc suite  i.e. free ringtones from midi files  free graphics from any picture on your computer  and if you know how to program jme you can even make your own apps / games . 
0, who knows how many uses you 'll get out of it before it craps out  but it probably will . 
1, battery recharge  is an awesome thing  because it recharges in only like 2-3 hours . 
1, even at the " normal " setting  a 8x10 print ! shows not a single sign of visible rendering or pixels - you could never tell that the picture has been taken by a " digital " . 
0, buttons do seem a little sticky tho .. and the hands free kits ' connector might be a problem .. 
0, sometimes  various applications crash .
0, as it stands now  the case is pretty useless unless you 're packing the player up for travel  or if you load up all your songs beforehand . 
0, granted  i have only used this dvd player for about 2 hours setting it up for my mom for christmas  but that was long enough for me to find problems with this dvd player . 
1, there 's even an equalizer ( under " settings " ) that allows you to adjust the sound for acoustic  bass booster  bass reducer  classical  dance  " deep "  and electronic .
1, the hitachi has plenty of power  runs smooth  and cuts effortlessly through maple ( with freud bits ! )
1, the wrt54g offers excellent security features and much more ( and easier ) configuration menu that i didn 't even need a manual to setup correctly .
1, the signal to noise ratio ( the ratio of detectable  useful data to unusable garbage in  say  a radio wave ; a larger stn ratio is better ) is nice and high at 98 decibles  and it should be noted that apple refuses to release the stn ratio of any of the ipods . 
1, i dont know what other people are saying  but the software is awesome . 
1, as the 6600 uses 900mhz  it operates in more countries than the 6620 .
0, it also has unproven battery life . 
0, the only thing i would complain about the zen xtra is that the controls are n't as easy as the ipod 's  or as " sexy " looking . 
0, my old siemens s56  on the other hand  worked beautifully with all of the above .
1, it is versatile and seems to be one of the best . 
1, i have had no problem what-so-ever with this product . 
0, however  i suspect that many people are having a bad experience -- do not purchase this product .
1, the battery is also convenient  but could have been better  such as the zen touch 's battery ( but at least this one is removable ) .
0, i have sent my ad2600 back to apex because it wo n't play certain disney and other dvd movies ( no disc message ) . 
1, one other plus is that napster now supports this device via their software . 
0, i 'm giving it 1 star because as compared to other nokia phones  its a 1  compared to other blunders by other companies ( such a samsung and motorrola ) it might be good .... but if you 're getting a nokia  don 't get this one .
1, white earbuds ( i replaced those with some shure headphones  big difference )  a case  a stand  a clip ( which doesn 't really work )  and a nice little zen micro bag .
1, i 've dropped it atleast a dozen times to my recolletion and it still works as good as ever .
0, i must say  this one is quite slow to open an application .
1, seriously  this thing has everything that a pro or expert amateur could want . 
0, the internet functions of the phone - wap and gprs - will only work through t-mobile 's services  because they have deleted the menu options that would enable you to configure the phone to be used on a different network . 
1, moving on to sound department ... it delivers !
1, the blue backlight is pretty cool .
0, both of the problem dvd 's would repeatedly freeze during playback  while the counter on the player kept going . 
0, our norton internet / av 2004 was terrible right from the get go  so i 'd think that if sytemworks is ok now  it should remain ok .
0, for one thing  the diapers always get jammed in it .
1, one good thing  it is 40 gb of disk space ( well  it is 38 gb in reality ) . 
1, overall build quality  good macros-results  impressive video-quality  good pictures with flash ( good colours  sharp results )  excellent auto white balance .
1, the pictures are fabulous and their is a ( short ) learning curve to it ; there are tons of features i have n't even gotten to . 
0, the only thing i don 't like is the small size ( 8 meg ) memory card that comes with it .
0, every time nomad thinks the file is corrupt the os freezes . 
1, i think the interface is great .
1, when the overall image quality ( especially natural colours  details  natural looking of the pictures ) is the most important thing  then this camera ist top notch and very impressive .
1, the unit works great with my cassette adapter for my car & is also easily worked without taking your eyes off the road ! 
0, respectable  solid  but not awe-inspiring .
0, the fact that the " 0 " key is the space key for text input is a bit confusing  as many phones use the " # " key instead . 
1, my favorite thing about the nomad is the eax feature . 
0, no way to contact their customer service . 
0, the eq is awful  and even at top volumes  the bass is flat sounding .
1, the zen is an outstanding way to shuttle music between sources  you can 't do this on the ipod ( except for a cumbersome work-around using the ipod as a hard drive instead of a player ) . 
1, but  for the money it is a good machine .
1, i find all of the controls well-placed and not flimsy in the least . 
0, -- > will not automatically transfer songs with identical titles ( if you have live albums or greatest hits albums  this will cause you inordinate frustration ). 
1, i use this with a home theater system and it 's amazing how it sounds  the picture clarity is unmatched ! 
1, the phone is sturdy .
0, also  their t-zones  although cheap ( $ 4.99 / mo. ) never works . 
1, initially these phones were fun to play with some of the cool features like the speaker phone  web browser and ofcourse the built in camera .

0, this is somewhat annoying  but from working with computers ( espcially windows -- ugh ... )
0, it is the ' first generation ' of the player  and while i still agree that it is a great alternative to the ipod  i think there are many others that would be a much better value for your buck .

1, first of all  the phone houses a great deal of memory for multiple videos  sound clips  photos  texts  etc .
0, it 's perfect for those who aren 't planning on storing tons of music .
0, the 2600 had false silver plate instead of play display .

1, i have n't messed with the firmware at all  the player worked perfect for me right out of the box . 
1, the price is incredible with the bonus pack and hitachi 's $ 25 incentive ( you need the code ---go to toolseeker.com and it tells you )
1, this means that there is a good chance that this phone will not break easily like typical american phones . 
0, my biggest concern is that i have found nokia phones lower quality construction to lead to lower prices  but they also don 't last as long .

1, in short  this player is good at size  value  hardware design but really bad at its software 
0, i did not managed to make creative nomad explorer to work . 
1, in terms of the shots taken  this camera is insanely great ! 
0, my gut tells me the nomad will in the long run be  at best  a 40gb portable hard drive  albeit one on which i can 't create folders  or  at worst  a very expensive lesson in companies never to buy products from again ( i have their audigy sound card and find it in many ways equally frustrating ) . 
1, have not had any issues with the headphones or fragility .
0, also  the earbuds that came with it sound great but are uncomfortable ( although my wife didn 't have a problem )  so i bought a pair of over-the-ear headphones .
1, but it comes with a tank of a case and if you cut a piece out where the screen is you can always keep it in the case and still access everything . 
1, the ear buds that come with it look cheap  but the sound quality is amazing .
0, ) button sensitivity : even reduced to the lowest sensitivity setting  the buttons are far two sensitive  really takes some getting use to  and even then  it is still too sensitive .
1, the screen is bright  easy to see in the daylight  with nice colors .

1, clear the call logs once in a while to speed up the phone people ! ! !
1, i can use it as a modem for my computer  connect with clients and friends  the possibilities are endless .
0, the scroll wheel  to be blunt  sucks . 
1, the battery on mine lasts 2 days if i don 't play games that much  and it only takes 90 mins to charge from flat .
1, in the hands of someone who does n't  it will yield good results on idiot program / auto mode . 
1, i finally decided to purchase this player because it was compatible with napster 2 go .... which is a subscription service  allowing me to download as much music as i want for a $ 14.95 flat fee .
1, in the auto mode it functions basically as a point and click  the scene modes are very easy to use and produce good results . 
0, the pc-side software can be goofy and takes a little getting used to but it 's not as bad as some reviewers have indicated . 
0, i was impressed by this very inexpensive player.for the first three hours  and then it died . 
0, the catch is that  while it plays movies just fine  it has refused to read second discs with the movie " extras " on them on the two occaisions when i tried to do that . 
0, i built my own router table with a tilt up top & made a hand crank to replace the height adjustment knob & these two things make it easy to change out & raise or lower the bits .
0, 6 . the zen nx battery requires the ac adapter to recharge ; it does not charge by usb cable ; this is not tragic  but usb recharging would be a convenient ( additional ) choice . 
0, but the major problem i had was with the software . 
1, i did n't think i would find this quality and ease of use for under $ 1500 - i 'm thrilled with my purchase ! 
1, 1 it has all the features an amatuer photo-enthusiast would want .

0, i 've sent 10 e-mails to their customer service department requesting an ra with no response . 
0, apex sucks ! 
1, the optical zoom works great and the 14x digital zoom is a very nice addition although pictures at the highest digital zoom are a little blurry .

1, it is amazingly small  it 's hard to believe all that has been packed into this camera .

1, i click pictures in jpg format and because the phone has a bluetooth device i find it extremely easy to transfer pics to my pc and forth .
1, it 's overkill for simple snapshots  unless you 've got way too much money to blow .
0, after 4 attempted installs  i have finally given up .
1, an extra gig of room  fm radio  voice recorder  pim applications with sync to outlook .
1, you can move the focus range to almost anywhere in the scene with the push of a button  and it has an on-screen manual focus mode that would be really helpful if shooting a scene that is tough to automatically focus . 
0, now it will not load any disk or just says that there is no disk . 
1, the quality is superb . 
1, i 'd highly recommend this camera for anyone who is looking for excellent quality pictures and a combination of ease of use and the flexibility to get advanced with many options to adjust if you like . 
1, this player is an ideal purchase . 
0, my only complaint and the reason i gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the on-camera controls aren 't as intuitive as they should be .

0, the face-plate  which pops out for the battery  pops open by itself every 10 minutes or so . 
1, no need to pay for the special refills that the other brands require !
0, . lens cap is a really annoying 
1, this is a fantastic tool to use .
1, at any rate  if you have been interested in digital photography but the price and confusion have held you back  consider the canon s100 digital elph .
1, but overall this is a good camera with a ' really good ' picture clarity ; an exceptional close-up shooting capability . 
1, the software you get with this camera is perfect . 
1, it definitely keeps the smell out .

1, there is no odor and extremely easy to use .
0, i would imagine this is a problem with any camera of a compact nature .
0, this was obviously a conspiracy as it is freakin ' easy to manufacture a device with replaceable batteries ! !
0, 2 . the scroll button is n't the best  as it sometimes can be hard to select . 
0, first of all  i bought this dvd as a christmas present for my girlfriend and i am somewhat disappointed .

1, yes  i recommend it over the competition . 
0, when you dial a number  you 'll need to check the screen to see that the number entered is correct .
0, they said they would refund all the money  but a month later  they tell me now the back-up disc is not refundable as its cost is purely handling and shipping - $ 15 to " handle " and ship a cd ? --and they have been indignant and combative on the phone and in emails .
1, really easy to use .
1, - the replacable battery is great since once it eventually wears out ( as all lithium batteries do )  you will be able to buy another easily . 
1, this is a well-made and powerful tool .
1, the daylight pictures are brilliant and the indoor shots are very good provided that your subject is no more than about 8 feet away .

1, it 's so small .
1, i found it very useful for transferring large files to another computer . 
1, the g3 looks like a work of art ! 
0, i 'd recommend this is you want to wireless network your laptop  but if you want to wirelessly network a couple desktops together you might want to wait until linksys improves their desktop software / hardware .
1, it is a perfect phone in such a small and appealing package . 
1, freebies you get : a cradle with detachable stand and belt clip  some thing very handy and useful .
1, noiseless  lightweight and oh yeah . 
0, for last one month my rebate status showing me that my rebate is apporved and check is delivered but still i am waiting for check .

1, manual functionality is excellent  downloading pictures is quick and a breeze  and the quality is astounding .

1, service is great as far as i can tell  features work like a charm  ringtones are high quality if you buy them from t-mobile and aim is great . 
1, the battery life lastes 12 hours  and charges quickly . ( as mentioned above  the initial charge is a minimum of only two hours - not too long at all ! ) once you 've downloaded your music  you can access the tracks by artist  genre  album  composer ( this comes in handy when the actual composer is different from the artist - e.g. covers of songs )  etc .
1, its fast-forward and rewind work much more smoothly and consistently than those of other models i 've had . 
1, i use it in the table ( never take the springs out - just attach the fine adjustment knob )  in my woodrat and freehand and it works great in all circumstances .

1, songs transfer lightning fast  and the two batteries that came in my box give me 24 hours of listen time .
1, the phone is small  light  and very attractive . 
1, however  the battery life is good enough you should n't be overly concerned with turning this phone off . 
1, the height is a more convenient reach than others  where you have to hunch over .
1, i 'd say that this camera is perfect .
0, made the camera totally inoperable . 
0, the unit itself did lock up a few times and i had to hit the reset button but that was a fairly painless process as well .

0, well flash photos are never great  and there was still a lot of noise . 
0, this item broke just two weeks after i gave it to my kids for christmas . 
1, i thought the fm radio would not see much use with so many tracks avaiable to me  but its great for tuning in to tv programs at the gym while on the treadmill  concerts and programs being simulcast  npr  and on and on .
1, i have it for a week now  and this camera has exceeded my expectations . 
0, unfortunately  this digital moment-capturing device called the g3 sometimes captures the moment after the one you wanted . 
0, after two weeks the picture kept freezing . 
1, i don 't have problems with the depth adjustment  the speed control  the collet ( i haven 't tried the 1 / 4 " sleeve yet ) .
1, i also own a retail store and this little guy easily plugs into my aux slot in the store 's sound system .
1, its just as fast as the included creative software  but much less invasive  and overall better looking .
1, it was a good player when it worked and i loved the design .
0, cons : no am / fm radio tuner-- something a large number of competetors are doing

0, - radio quality : weak reception

0, diapers can get stuck when turned around if you don 't tightly wrap them first .
1, 3 band and you can just change the sim card in it to be able to use it in europe with another service provider .
1, the fact that this model would play jpeg slideshows was a big plus for me as a visual artist  and i discovered by accident ( it is not mentioned anywhere in the literature ) that it will play mpeg1 files on a regular cd-r data disk without vcd formatting . 
1, the blue light also makes this player one of the most fashionable in the market also .
0, but when we went to use it again  there was sound but no picture . 
1, i love this player and am extremely happy with my decision . 
0, there was occasionally a lip-sync issue ( the lips were n't moving in time to the dialogue ) . 
1, sound quality is wonderful  i really like the smart volume sound normalization . 
1, this player is absolutely phenomenal  i haven 't had any problems  and if you 're worried you will have problems  i suggest buying it at a retail store that has a good return policy but anyways ... i find the touch pad very easy to use  and i 'm surprised so many people have had problems .
1, lots of flaws  but exceptional sound quality  hd size  and price make it a good buy . 
1, the photo quality is amazing and i know i 'm going to have fun with all the features . 
0, weaknesses are minor : the feel and layout of the remote control are only so-so ; it does n't show the complete filenames of mp3s with really long names ; you must cycle through every zoom setting ( 2x  3x  4x  1/2x  etc. ) before getting back to normal size [ sorry if i 'm just ignorant of a way to get back to 1x quickly ] . 
1, i thought the software was decent enough - it was n't complicated to learn at all . 
0, the panel seems like it will come off very easily as other people have said . 
1, it 's good .
0, it 's oftentimes hard to get a good grip on the router  activate the chuck lock  and get enough muscle behind the wrench to get the collet loosened up .

1, first of all the player 's sound quality is superior to the ipod . 
1, love the speaker phone .
0, it comes with a rechargable battery that does not seem to last all that long  especially if you use the flash a lot . 
0, very bad quality . 
0, i could hardly use it without a recharge in 2 days !
0, im at full capacity ! ! ! ! i called symantic and they said they don 't know why but i should get tech 's support at $ 35 / hr to help ! ! i did call them and was on hold for 55 minutes untill i hung up !
1, i love this camera .
1, of course  i was hesitant given the price  but i 've been extremely impressed since receiving it  and bought a second one as a christmas present for my parents . 
0, the only thing missing is an option to adjust the balance . 
1, so sit back  relax and brag to all your friends who paid a mountain of money for a dvd player that can 't do half the things this one can  and for a fraction of the price ! 
1, its silver magnesium finish is stunning  and the sharp lines and excellent grip are better than any other camera i 've seen . 
1, i uploaded the drivers and new software in 15 minutes - no crashes or problems . 
1, the good : 1 ) large lcd screen  colorful display  good resolution .
1, the router works fine for both wired and wireless .

0, 6 ) the case occludes the display screen when it is closed . 
1, it is small . 
1, it 's easy to use  and yet very feature rich . 
1, especially the lcd is big and the camera quality is among the very best around .
0, i downloaded this set from norton  and within minutes my internet connection failed and my pc was almost dead due to registry problems from the download .
0, i then tried to set up the router through linksys 's browser interface  but as the only instructions available tell you to use the installation cd  i had little luck - i did manage to connect briefly  but the connection kept dropping  and with no idea of how to resolve that issue  i gave up .
1, seriously ! i love it ! 
0, norton internet security 2004 is one of the more buggy implementations .
0, within one month  my player completely died .
1, also  the nomad 's 14 hours of battery life versus 8 is handy . 
1, there are better cameras but none anywhere near as light and compact .
1, if you bring up an album  but absolutely hate some of the tracks  the zen will allow you to delete that from the playing order . 
0, the only beef i can raise in this regard is the pop-off face  that sometimes comes off a bit easily  but besides that it 's perfect . 
0, the other day when i was listening to a song  it locked up and will not do anything now . 
0, same story as everybody else when trying to get service from apex - nothing .

1, owner 's manual has substandard troubleshooting guide . 
1, the camera is solid  performs well  takes good pictures  and the battery lasts pretty long if you disable the lcd viewfinder .
0, also  diapers and wipes get stuck in the grove below the piston .
0, the screen is easily scratched but if you have the warranty you should be able to swap it out . 
0, minor complaints : 1 ) even though the music is sorted via id3 tag on the player  the option to search for music contained in a folder is unavailable . 
1, functionality  menus are easy to navigate ... as many have mentioned  the touch pads take some time to get used to  but i 've gotten used to it .
1, this camera also has a great feel and weight to it .

0, always carried it in a case in by briefcase but one day the hard drive just zapped . 
1, i didnt get ipod because i dont especially like itunes ( no music i want  but thats just me ) and the creative product was cheaper ; and i needed to be able to use wma files .

0, after research of other creative hard drive players  i found that most of them aren 't very durable and tend to crash ( read most reviews on amazon.com and see for yourself ) .
1, t-mobile is trying very hard  and again -- they do have pretty good csr 's . 
1, the sound is great  the portability  etc ... all the " stuff " you expect from a good mp-3 player  this zen micro has it .
1, the camera is a dream to operate in automode  but also gives tremendous flexibility in aperture priority  shutter priority  and manual modes . 
1, the controls are easy to understand and big enough that they are easy to see and use .
1, also  very light and portable . 
1, the sound quality is excellent  except  maybe a * tad * too quiet at times when there are quieter talkers on the other end of the line . 
0, i send my camera to nikon for servicing  took them a whole 6 weeks to diagnose the problem . 
0, as a computer  or pda its weak since the screen  while large by phone standards  is still tiny to really do anything on .
1, also  the display is " hinged " and it can be placed in a myriad of positions  or to protect it against any damage . 
1, hold button-- suprisingly not all mp3s have this ; this allows you to have all the buttons unusable  so that you don 't accidently hit something in your pocket .
1, while it didn 't have all the features i would have liked  it was better than anything else i could find at the time .
1, if you want a sharp looking  fast digital camera and you don 't need or want manual controls  then this is the camera for you !

1, on the contrary  i 'm quite pleased with my upgrade .
0, i can 't rate it one star only because when it does work it 's pretty good . 
1, i discovered that the camera has a manual mode that gives you total control over exposure  white balance  flash ( red eye  person against bright background  flash on  flash off  flash automatic ) .
1, in fact  people who have been present while i changed my almost 3 month old son 's diaper have been amazed at how the very ' potent ' smell of the dirty diaper seems to disappear once i dispose of the diaper in the diaper champ .
0, i downloaded the new firmware which was supposed to take care of the problem  but it hasn 't worked .

0, software - music match jukebox is n't the greatest  the search funtion is n't fast even when accessing it with the hotkey shortcut . 
1, i particularly like the " txt " file which records all the control information for all the pictures you take. 
1, another good thing is that this camera seems to introduce much less noise in dark places than others i 've seen . 
1, the battery holds a charge for a very long time ( maybe 15 or so hours of use ) so realistically there are no real range or endurance issues associated with ipod use .

1, you feel like you are holding something of substance  not some cheap plastic toy .

1, at 8 ounces it is pretty light but not as light as the ipod . 
1, works great  no odor  and uses regular bags .
0, d ) software is another great misfortune -- hard to operate  crashes frequently  screwed my music library up  doesnt work with mp4s  the list goes on and on 
1, i must have gotten a good one .
1, the digital zoom takes as good of pictures  as the optical zoom does ! 
1, the display and brightness on this phone is quite extraordinary .
0, second  the menu system and controls are poorly designed . 
0, in addition  i do not think the battery lasts much more than eight to ten hours  and it can take four hours for a full charge .

1, it has all the features one would need in a cellphone . 
1, the phone offers a 32 mb mmc card and i think that is certainly the most exciting feature .
1, as far as linksys goes  i have used several of their products and they seem to hold up well - no problems .
0, and  when you think about it  it 's insulting that norton requires its customers to jump through these hoops -- anyone who can provide proof of purchase  whether on the phone or online ( what if your computer is down ? )  should have equal priority .
1, i must admit its not the best looking phone ever but then it has this look of static and absolute conviction that looks like everything a phone should be
1, i like the nomad 's color better  but it 's not terribly flashy . 
1, this is a nice feature ( i.e. it 's early in the morning and you rather listen to " easy listening " rather than " heavy metal " - no problem . 
1, i upgraded from nis 2003  and the change in performance has not been noticeable .
1, transfering is easy  the software makes everythig pretty easy . 
1, we 've never experienced odor from the pail .
1, mixed bag i guess but the price was right . 
0, if you hold down the scroll wheel too long ( which is common if you have a lot of songs to sort through )  it will get " stuck " rapidly going through the songs and wo n't stop until several seconds after you let your finger off of it . 
0, if you have an older version of " internet security " installed  you may also need to remove it as well before proceeding with systemworks install .
0, the first one we installed did n't work  and our kids were devastated to say the least . 
0, almost from the beginning  liveupdate would not function .
0, the flash is very weak .

1, the picturers are amazing . 
1, reliability & build i dropped the player once from about 4 ft  and it fell hard  but kept on playing .

1, it takes excellent pics and is very easy to use  if you read the manual . 
1, as said before this works perfectly . 
1, all at the same time  and all without a hitch .
1, after considering my needs further and researching the marketplace  i decided on the s100 .
1, i 've owned this router for over 8 years and am somewhat satisfied with it .
1, another good feature is that you can charge the battery by just connecting the player to your computer using the usb cable .
0, * i 'm giving it 4 stars because the setup process was so miserable .
1, this is a great product  and canon has done an excellent job .
0, while the software may not be as easy as i-tunes  it is not difficult to use by any stretch .
1, this is a wonderful camera . 
1, the appearance is okayed ( at least not ugly ) . 
1, once installed  however  some of the functions do work ok ( disk doctor  one button checkup  and windoctor ) .
1, the sound quality is also nice ... after i hooked up my sony headphones instead of those factory earbuds it comes with . 
1, on the t-mobile service i was able to take pics as we drove across i-70 and email them to family & friends once we reached a t-mobile tzone ( usually a major city ) .
1, battery life is exceptional  lasting longer than the 8-10 hours that seem reasonable with most music players on the market .
0, limitations : - not a lot of original accessories like the ipod .
1, a call to customer support ( got to a live person within a couple of minutes ) helped me tweak a couple of the settings to streamline performance .
0, the toggle button that is used to scroll is poorly designed and does not work well . 
1, it 's still alive  still kicking  and still playing .
1, it 's a compact  attractive machine and was easy to set up . 
1, i did not conduct a rigorous test  but just took some identical shots in identical lighting with both cameras  and the canon won hands down .
1, its sleek design  large memory capacity  compatibility with itunes  and ease of use makes this one of the best portable digital listening devices on the market .
0, if you call apple and tell them your ipod has been damaged  they charge you roughly $ 105.50 per minute and blame you for " abusing " your ipod .
1, it 's so small and light  even with a spare battery  you really can take it anywhere .
1, great camera  i have been using this for several months and got excellent results  simple friendly usage  in many scenes indoor  outdoor  snow  close up macro etc. 
1, diaper champ is great .
0, i would have liked to have given it 4 1/2 stars docking that 1/2 star only for the size . 
1, even though you could get a cheap router these days  i 'm happy i spent a little extra for the linksys .
0, enough people have reported that their headphone jack does n't work after a month of using the device to believe that creative has some inbuilt manufacturing or quality control problem . 
1, and with usb 2.0  transferring music to your player is incredibly easy . 
0, there are a couple of quirks that were a bit annoying like having to actually press the power button before the tray will open ( my prev. machine did it automatically )  and the fact that the external display is too small and too faded to read from any significant distance . 
0, however  configuration of my system and actual setup of the router for wireless use took me more than 3 hours  and briefly made me reconsider my choice to forego the airport and its notoriously easy setup .
0, the only problem is the battery life .
0, however  it needs to be quite quiet for it to work at all -- dosn 't work at all in the car  for example .
1, it also holds a lot more diapers .
0, booting up my computer took forever ! ! !
1, the zen has minimal stoppage between tracks ; when listening to music that continues from one track to the next the gap is just a hesitation - a slightly audible click ; if i am not listening for the progress from one track to the next i do n't even notice the click . 
0, the video recorders a bit odd  sometimes i get 9 secs on my recordings  sometimes i get 17 .
1, i love the diaper champ  it is really easy to use and since you can use regular garbage bags it doesn 't cost an arm and a leg for refills .
1, other than that  the simbian series 60 os is great and offers lots of proprietary software that will work on your phone if you 're willing to hunt for it .
1, the camera and video functionality is decent  i can 't see myself wasting my time with it  but some people will .
1, this is a great diaper pail .
1, the nikon coolpix 4300 is wonderful -- easy to use  high quality  and compact in size . 
1, nokia does not disappoint in this model . 
1, its not a perfect system but its a very good one .
0, it is some protection for the unit  but for useability  forget it . 
1, the first night i got this phone i put it next to me when i went to bed just to listen to my favorite music station and the handset itself doesnt weight anything its too light and feel so comfy with it . 
1, i have been absolutely  completely satisfied with the product and its capabilities .
0, mine generally requires a charege every 48 hours or so and i don 't really talk on it that much .
0, with the plungelift all my bit changing has been done above the table  although i still have to reach below the table to operate the spindle lock ( and  of course  the speed and on / off controls ) .
1, i upgraded from a very small 3.2 mpxl camera to this camera with great results .
0, i have tried many times to get a hold of apex who does n't seem to answer their emails and telephone number is constantly busy as ( i believe ) the one lonely customer service rep is probably extremely overworked . 
1, for looks  well ipod is head and shoulders better  both the iriver and creative zen look positively ugly when next to a gleaming ipod .
0, this phone is not suitable for fast people  maybe only for old people .
1, the inital setup of the router was simple .
1, the zen lives up to the audio quality i love and expect .
1, i highly recommend this camera to anybody looking for a compact camera that can take good quality pictures .
1, the earbud headphones are really nice .
1, the zen serves as a back-up device as well as a player . 
0, the g3 had problems focusing in low light and would not take the picture when the shutter was pressed but after the shutter had been released a few seconds . 
0, i find that if you remove the springs it is much easier to adjust and will not stick much .
0, what is added in functionality ( battery replacement ) detracts in build quality as the face plate is prone to popping off . 
1, 12 ) big storage - my entire cd collection in one small device ( 5717 songs  491 albums and counting ) ! 
0, stay away from this product !
1, we just use the glad tall kitchen trash can bags with odor shield from target and they work wonderfully .
1, this camera has canon 's great colorimetry  plus what you see in the lcd is what you get . 
0, the dynamic playlists ( " now playing "  i belive creative calls it ) feels very awkward at times and some menus simply take to long to get to and operate .. . 
1, 3 ) 4x zoom is nice 
1, it is light enough to carry around all day without bother . 
1, i still give the ipod five stars  though  as it could have been something i did incorrectly during the install ( though i did follow the onscreen prompts ) so i 'll give apple the benefit of the doubt .
1, it will read and play all cd audio disc . 
1, 1 ) the champ is easy to use .
0, 2 ) not very ergonomical - you 'll find even for a point-and-shoot lens ) 
1, i would however highly recommend the m12v router !
0, i mean  they 're short !
1, 1 ) great sound ( > 98db signal-to-noise ratio beats ipod 's " unspecified " ratio ) and good power output allow the zen xtra to drive large head-phones as well as external speakers . 
0, since zen does not have an external antena it has some problems catching weak signals but it works .
0, 1 ) player is not plug and play - need to install nomad explorer first and mediasource to transfer files and i had to be patient as i was used to winxp detecting the player and dragging and dropping the music files into it . 
1, less than a cheap cordless drill or a laminate trimmer .
1, the setup software did everything .
0, and i can 't warn you enough to stay away from norton ! !
1, i 'm very pleased with my zx so here 's a quick review . 
0, -- > too difficult to change genre / album / track information for large number of tracks . 
1, 4 . play n-gage games on it .
1, i love how small the thing is  and the blue glow - i 've had it for two weeks with no electronic problems at all .
1, 1 ) slr like programming and exposure control gives you latitude to be creative  yet its progam and auto exposure settings provide excellent photos if you do n't want to bother with the settings . 
1, i just purchased this player and i have to say that i love it . 
1, my dad also has an apex tv and it was another great value for the money . 
1, i 'd be happy to talk to anyone about this camera .
0, the ms scandisk would appear due to manual shutdown and would only scan to the 2nd bar  over and over ( up to 1 hr  i then shut it down and used goback ) .
1, 5 . check traffic411.com for la traffic on the 405 .
0, it was immediately noticeable that nis slows down my computer ( pent4  256 ram ) .
1, this camera has none of these flaws and will be something you 'll use all the time . 
0, we found that when you put a dirty diaper into the top loader  there was a tendency to get streaks which would then get on the plunger which would then have to get cleaned each time it was used .
0, one downside though is that autofocus does not work well when battery is low . 
1, however  for a $ 600 - $ 800 budget  i think this camera is an excellent choice . 
1, it is a nice router in all ways but one .
0, well just one con - its not really plug and play at first i mean its very confusing to start the program but one you do it  it will be a breeze . 
1, even though i never ventured into the cloth land  i was very impressed by how well this works at keeping diapers and their accompanying odor in the pail and out of our life !
1, - equipment included is average  but that is n't a big deal since thats not what you are buying it for . 
0, even with newborn diapers it filled way too fast .
0, i have windows xp pro and when installing the enclosed software i did receive a message that there was a problem installing the driver . 
1, the sound quality is very good . 
0, it would not hang up on calls .
0, one of the dvd 's i received as a christmas present kept freezing . 
0, being a past norton customer  i consider this to be a slap to my face .
1, with bluetooth off the phone last almost twice as long .
1, can recommend the hitachi in this ergonomic arena -- at the price quoted on amazon it is a bargain .
1, 7 ) chic look and good build - the player comes in a compact form with a metal face plate . 
0, the keys are close together  and the layout is a bit funky in relation to standard rectangular layout keypads  but it 's not too weird . 
1, not only is it more affordable  but its a better player for windows  which is what i have . 
0, the thing has survived plenty of falls with little or no damage  except the inevitable scratches .
0, the only complaint i have is that when you push in the scroll wheel to select  you have to push straight in or it sticks . 
1, just received this camera two days ago and already love the features it has . 
0, this program would not let me send outlook email or listen to audible sample books online .
1, it looks nice and sleek and the blue background light looks awesome against the black .
1, in true nokia style  the phone is simple to use and despite its delicate appearance  this little guy is as durable as other nokias i have owned . 
1, some features that the ' zen micro ' has that sold me on my purchase include : a 5g hard drive ... actually an sd flash card drive ... very large and much more than actually needed  the ability to sync with microsoft outlook 's calendar  the long battery life of about 10 to 12 hours ( i can change the battery myself for about $ 40 to buy vs .
1, i love the performance and features of this router .
1, sound i 'm no audiophile but i was amazed by the clarity the player had  it was much better than the sound card on my computer and louder too .
1, if you 'll only read the whole manual  you 'll find out even more cool features and you 'll learn how to manipulate the quality you want to achieve and all those modes will make sense after reading
0, as i wrote  this could have been a great product  but expect hidden charges ( read gross profiteering and price gouging ) as the company royally sticks you on every conceivable accessory necessary for normal daily usage .
1, ooh  and i dropped it and it still works fine : this little camera has so many features i have n't even gotten to all of them yet . 
1, another point of note : the battery life is incredible ! 
1, the manual is excellent .
1, + screen was good  easy to read 
1, great screen and great sound . 
1, the player works well with my sony srs-a 202 powered speakers . 
1, i highly recommend this phone .
1, well surely this is a product that i recommend someone in getting rather than any other mp3 player ( at that size and the price ) . 
1, i use it on a router table  and it is works well .
0, if you are new to the market and looking to buy a symantec software product  save yourself some money and buy the 2003 version .
0, it would work fine for a while then as the motor warmed up it would die .
1, this phone won me over  and a big seller was the size ; it fits nicely into any pocket without falling out . 
1, so far it all works fine with either cable or wireless connections .
0, we constantly got " windows virtual memory low " error messages popping up follwed by ridiculous slowdowns and / or crashes .
1, 7 ) some people have problems with the flip switch on the bottom that releases the player cover - has not been an issue for me and is immaterial if you use the case as the case covers the switch . 
1, goes ~ 3 days after a charge .
1, but i 've already emailed creative tech support about it  and gotten timely responses - they will fix it for me if necessary .. . 
1, i have only had this camera for one full day and i have to say that it is wonderful . 
1, and it is very easy to clean .
1, the nokia 6610 is a relatively new phone  and what a great phone it is . 
0, the catch with the canon g3 camera  ( and perhaps all of digital cameras ) is that its unresponsiveness will cause you to miss precious shots . 
1, the base was deeper and the highs were crisper .
1, i received this item for christmas and it has met and exceeded all my standards . 
0, this product is too fragile for normal use . 
1, i bought my canon g3 about a month ago and i have to say i am very satisfied . 
1, overall this is the best phone i have ever owned . 
0, only downside is when taking pictures in low-light conditions without the flash .
0, i 've often struggled to get something to work the way i want it  and hate to have to carry the manual with me all the time !
0, i 'm an advocate of nokia  but this phone and the following models ( 7610 )  are seemingly a desperate trial at squeezing as much under-engineered and experimental technologies in one sloppy phone .
1, 3 ) the champ is odor free for at least 15 months .
1, sound quality is amazing. i was expecting worse  but its really good ( especially if your files have good sound quality ) . 
1, it has everything i needed : bluetooth  infrared  support for mmc  camera  and a good operating system with lots of supporting software .
1, the m12v has been great .
0, * lens visible in optical viewfinder . 
0, and if you 're a mac user like me  they 've naturally made sure you have no viable alternative .
0, even the pdf manual that comes with it is pretty vague for someone not familiar with " mac settings "  etc .
0, although i disabled norton antispam  it is still there .
0, so  i 've had it for a month  and the headphone jack went out . 
1, thank you apple ! you make fabulous products .
1, it powers up quickly  so you won 't miss that quick shot .
1, either way  can 't go wrong with this price . 
1, i 'm not sure why all the bad reviews  my computer isn 't especially slowed down and i have win ' 98 .
1, i am a big fan of itunes  simply because it is terribly fast and convenient - if you are buying the songs from the itunes site .
1, ) no locked-in proprietary business like apple ; this baby plays wmas too .
1, i did a ton of research and settled on this phone because of the small size  speakerphone option  great priced calling plan and access to my corporate email . 
1, price ! 
1, great phone .. . 
1, after a lengthy and extensive journey for a feature-loaded  high performance  travel size camera  i initially gravitated to this little gem because of the superior picture quality 4 mega pixel . 
1, i must have differing preferences than others here  as i prefer the supplied earbuds to the sony 's that i thought sounded good on other players . 
1, i 've been using the g3 for about six weeks and it has proven itself to be all that it 's advertised . 
1, finding a particular song ( s ) or album on the nomad jukebox is fast and easy . 
1, for a sleeker  smaller and more " average " mp3 player the nitrus is great but the ipod blows it out of the water - the interface is great and the design is wonderful .
1, the manual modes give you a lot of control over exposure and white balance ( but there is no manual focus or manual exposure ) .
0, first  it failed whenever connecting to get updates .
0, it sounds decent  but i would estimate you get maybe 80 % of the quality that you would from a true line out jack . 
1, loved the slim design . 
0, i find the lack of entertaining games on this phone quite disturbing . 
1, also  the touchpad seems to be waterproof to some degree .
1, the headphone earbuds are average  so just use your regular pair instead . 
1, i highly recommend this camera to anyone looking for a good digital camera that takes great pictures yet does n't take weeks to figure out how to operate .

0, - not playing some dvds and then finally after less than 60 days  it just would not recognize anything i pop in it .

1, the scroll button seems ok  i have no problems with it . 
1, it was so easy my toddler would dispose of her on diapers .
1, overall it is a great value .
0, to address two previous somewhat negative reviews : ( 1 ) yes  the lens barrel does obstruct part of the lower left corner in the lens viewfinder ; however  the lcd viewfinder is rather stunning and i find myself rarely using the lens viewfinder . 
1, usb 2.0 - very fast 
1, the controls are on the side instead of on the front  which i like  because that 's where my thumb is when i hold the thing ! 
0, as a loyal customer of norton / symantec products  i purchased internet security 2004 as a software firewall and could not be any more dissatisfied with the product ( and hence the one star rating ) .
1, 5 stars all the way !
0, on occasion i 'm not able to connect to the phone with isync via bluetooth but i found that rebooting the phone seems to solve this problem .
1, . itunes-- this is a love-hate relationship program ; usually people with mac like this program than people with a pc  but depending on your computer expertise  this could be a difficult program to use  and it is required for an ipod .
0, now  the player 's ear phone jack is not working - i have to send it away again .
1, could be better to be a perfect camera ( and some competitors do some of this better ) : purple fringing  details in high-light area  noise over iso100  red-eyes  ( few ) processing artefacts  ( few ) loss of some details especially of the hairs of peoples in low light  automatic autofocus  whizing while video-playback  better video comression ( smaler viedo-files )  more manual controls  longer lasting battery  indicator for battery  better protection of the lcd  less weight .
1, multimedia functions are enhanced by multi-slide mms messages and a gallery for organizing digital content captured or downloaded with the phone .

1, this is the best phone i have seen . 
0, the program brings more problems than a virus  albeit not as major problems  just not what you expect for 70 bucks .
0, the fine adustment knob which came with the router was very difficult to use on a router table .
1, contrary to what ive read elsewhere  the g3 does sync at 1/250 of a second with third-party flashes  just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon . 
0, i sent it back  as i think that the speed control is either poorly designed or defective .
1, the radio works excellent in my area  i 'm not sure everywhere else .
1, thankfully  creative has come through with a product that puts the ipod back in its place .
1, took hundreds of pictures and they were great . 
0, even after all the nightmare sound problems  i 'd still half-way like this product if it kept it 's promise ; the ability to store 1500 songs .
0, this player is not worth any price and i recommend that you do n't purchase it . 
0, finally you will read a post somewhere that all codes are useless for the apex 2600 .

0, as of october  2004  these products are not working and i 'm ready to demand a refund from symantec .
0, also if you do manage to get it installed  any problems with liveupdate or with system works will also affect the functionality and / or the process of updating internet security .
1, the battery life seems good  takes very lttle time to charge  it uploads mp3s quickly and there is no delay between songs . 
1, great features .. . 
1, the eax features are pretty cool  as well  as creative has included a number of eq adjustments that  for example  compensate for the extraneous noise encountered in a car or on a train . 
1, the camera is as easy to use as a point and shoot  and with instant review on the lcd screen  you can retake any flubbed shots on the spot .
1, i loaded a lot of photos into it and they display very clearly for such a small screen and  very importantly  the transition from one photo to the next is instantaneous .
1, the ipod is not overpriced compared to the market .
0, they are not wowable good . 
0, this camera uses a lithium battery  i find lithium batteries to be highly inconvenient ; because what if you are on vacation  where the nearest place to buy batteries is just a gas station--there is no way that you are going to find lithium batteries there .
1, i have not been disappointed with my purchase . 
0, recenly the variable speed control went out .
1, so far the software for the pc works easily .

1, i 've connected the phone with two laptops and a ipaq 4155 .
1, your choice of ten colors in a beatiful package .
1, battery non-issue .
1, this camera has a cool stitch pictures feature  to find out more just log on to canon 's website . 
1, overall  i 'm giving this 5 stars as i 've seen nothing of the problems people have repeatedly cried havoc over  but as i 've only had the player for a while i leave room for doubt if the headphone jack  hissing  or scroll wheel problems show up with me too . 
1, very fast powerup and great speed when taking multiple pictures .
0, what this product really needs is better documentation for how to set up the router for different operating systems !
1, ive seen em all  the archos  dell  ipods  everything ... good price and great sound makes this one the best in my opinion . 
1, lots of sound options  has an equalizer almost like winamp with the options . 
0, 1. creative mediasource software is ok to rip  catalog & burn music if you are starting from scratch ; but i used musicmatch to rip my cds before i bought the zen ( 278 cds ; 3400 tracks ; 12.5 gb of music all ripped at 128bps ) and guess what ? 
1, it holds plenty of songs .
1, the 6600 ( t-mobile ) is the true ' world phone ' in that it has the mhz to operate around the globe  including new zealand and australia ( 900 ) whereas the 6620 ( available from cingular ) replaces it w / 800mhz ( some refer to as 850 ) .
1, overall  this router seems like a reasonably priced product th !
1, the leather case it comes with is pretty nice  similar to a pda style case and does hold and protect it perfectly .

1, why bother when it works perfectly with media player 10 ?
0, well  my second one is now beginning to hicup a bit after about 1 1 / 2 years .

1, i love this camera !
1, i am very pleased with the apex ad2600.it plays just about anything you put in the drawer . 
0, however  the main problem that i think is the with the sound quality . 
1, let the champ win you over !
0, if you 've been listening to cd 's in your car for awhile  dealing with the drop-off in sound quality may take some getting used to .
1, technology wise  i think this is awesome plus the speaker makes it even great ! ! ! ! i love this phone ! ! !

1, dependability : i 've seen no glitches .
1, - very long-lasting battery life 
1, feels solid in hand . 
1, this phone has a very cool and useful feature -- the speakerphone . 
0, if you think you are saving $ 40 getting the hitachi  you are right  and you are also getting a router worth $ 40 less than a makita .
1, it 's easy to use  and makes transfering your cd collection to the player a cinch .
0, the only disappointment so far has been battery life .
1, simple to use and hook up . 
1, the phone book is very user-friendly and the speakerphone is excellent . 
0, the creative software is awkward / difficult to use and just plain does n't load on some computers . 
0, maybe it is my lack of experience  but i found shots with this camera very disappointing . 
1, i did not have any of the installation problems that people highlighted here .
1, you can adjust the volume to be heard anywhere or so that it does n't make that big of a disturbance . 
1, i upgraded from an older 801.11b router to the linksys wrt54g for its improved security  and of course  speed .
0, the only problem i had was a few components didn 't quite load correctly upon startup  but a reboot fixed the problem .
1, frankly  i think this is one of the niftiest pieces of hardware i 've ever used .
0, do not buy this product -- 
0, after reading reviews of lcd problems  cracked  black blobs etc  i figured that it was probably a very limited problem .
0, remote buttons are small and closely spaced  especially with the menu buttons . 
1, in addition it comes with a sleek and powerful headset . 
1, there are extra features packed inside this unit ( some that most will hardly ever use ) such as fm radio tuner  voice recorder  calendar  and alarm clock .
1, also love waking up to music with attached speakers . 
0, my case doesnt close ... maybe mine was just faulty  but the case isnt that great . 
0, i did see the review here and other places about a cracked lcd screen .
1, i have come across many other beginner cameras that i prefer over this camera  but the thing you have to keep in mind about this camera is the size .
1, there are 3 computers in my house all getting wireless connection from this router  and everybody is happy with it .
1, four megapixels is great . 
0, was a bit wary because the software is windows only and i have an imac .
0, it seems to me that after the focus and metering are complete there is quite a lag before the shutter ? 
1, one primary reason for getting a cell phone was so that i could use it as an internet connection for my laptop running linux  where softmodem drivers are hard to find  and don 't work very well .
1, the included eax support is useful at times  especially when you listen to a variety of genres  as it will adjust the equalizer for you which can be a big hassle . 
0, the one other thing i observed while i had the nomad is that the front cover  which is taken off to have access to the battery  seemed to come undone very easily . 
0, unit took forever since the begiining to recognize and play discs . 
1, battery life  the drawback to most digital cameras  to quote k. reeves . 
1, basic usage is easy  but the remote has a lot of buttons that i have n't used . 
1, while going for a cellphone  i was fully determined to buy a nokia only as it is the best in cellphones . 
0, this unit was working fine for the 1st month and a half and then the color signal disappeared . 
1, the infrared is a blessing if you have a previous nokia and want to transfer your old phone book to this phone  saved me hours of re-entering my numbers . 
0, most of us just want to plug and play  not spend a year navigating a maze of complicated options ... like transfering everything on a hard drive to this stupid thing .
0, c ) the scroll bar is a travesty -- enough said 
1, the creative labs zen xtra has all the features the i-pod has and if you get if from amazon your only going to pay $ 300 for this great player . 
1, navigation is so smooth and finding files is a cinch . 
0, the most recent is that it will stop responding to the on/off button . 
0, i tried to play the song three times  with no success . 
0, no problems now  just a sickly disappointment in the way norton has abandoned thier customers .

0, then it started to smell whether there were diapers in it or not .
1, downloads are a snap and quick . 
1, best in class .
1, i love that you can create custom playlists  and organize music in so many different ways .
0, the subscription files are still a little slower to transfer  but it 's only by about 10 % or so .
1, with one of the most intuitive user-interfaces around  seamless bluetooth sync with microsoft outlook  support for thousands of applications for the symbian platform which this phone runs on ( i own the ir remote  icq and a few others )  the nokia 6600 is all of the above - one of the few phones from t-mobile that can claim such a distinction .
1, the card basically installed itself and the " install wizard " on the cd that came with the router basically set the router up to work with one computer ( with the 54g card ) and also a second computer in my house ( with an 11b card ) .
0, norton online support does not even acknowledge this problem nor does the computer company that preloaded it on our new computer .
1, the larger lens of the g3 gives better picture quality in low light  and the 4-times optical zooms gets you just that much closer . 
0, the sliding latch is does not stay in place .
1, it is a multifunction phone  reception quality is better than the 610 .
1, the scroll wheel is easy to use and works great for me  however many have complained that the wheel is cumbersome and difficult to operate . 
0, however  the battery life isn 't as good as i would like .
0, for example  in auto mode you can 't use the flash redeye reduction  you must be in manual mode for that .
0, i say adequate because it was enough to get wireless working  but nowhere near enough instruction to do the proper configuration job that i could have done if so !
1, i love the features  the interface  the size ( the screen is a delight )  the camera ( though i admit i 'm not much of a camera user -- so just a toy for me )  the internet connectivity  the quality  etc .
1, handsfree future is good  but not too exciting .
1, the progressive scan option can be turned off easily by a button on the remote control which is one of the simplest and easiest remote controls i have ever seen or used . 
1, our special friends at creative gave this thing good sound quality  great features  long battery life  and an unbeatable price . 
0, i would not be inclined to purchase an apex product again . 
1, over all a fantastic very compact camera  which made us experience photography on a totally new level ! 
1, the 6600 has more ameneties than most - world phone  camera ( vga / zoom / night mode / timer )  video ( w / audio & zoom )  speaker ( good sound )  bluetooth  infrared  modem for computers  electronic wallet  internet access  calendar  calculator  converter and more .
0, when i purchase software  i never want to have to spend hours looking up solutions to my install problems -- in particular solutions that involve manually setting driver preferences or editing the registry !
0, i also put a bend in the wrench so i can remove and install bits from the top of the table .
1, i decided to go with the diaper champ rather than the more popular diaper genie  because i didn 't like the idea of having to buy special bags .
0, i called apex 's support number numerous times but it just kept ringing . 
0, got a " system error " problem 30 days after purchase . 
1, this phone is great as a whole and is not like others with one or two good qualities . 
1, simply  the canon g3 is the best digital camera out there today at this price point . 
1, i really dislike holding a phone to my ear  and i 've found the freespeak to be very comfortable and easy to use with this phone .
1, touchups  redeye  and so on are very easy to alter  and correct . 
0, don 't use them  so i delete them for addtl space .
1, * holds a lot of diapers--a full week of toddler diapers !
1, the manual mode is easy to use with fast access for the selection of shutter speed and aperture without having to fumble through menu options . 
1, i 've had this player for more than 4 months and i 'm very happy with it .
0, i took my zen micro with me over the weekend  and was forced to lug my laptop with me on the trip for one reason : to keep the zen micro charged .
0, the performance of the router itself deserves 5 stars  but the linksys documentation and support is so poor that i can only give it 4 .
0, the two limitations i knew i would have to deal with are the very long lag time before it focus-locks ( even in bright light )  and the unsatisfactory light quality of the built-in flash . 
0, the hitachi collet simply was not ground accurately .
0, while i was trying to play half life 2 it started popping up with " alerts " every twenty seconds ( literally )  warning me my antivirus protection was off .
1, they are extremely convient and you don 't have to buy them seperately has i-tunes  which provides qulity music at low prices .
1, i was more excited about this player upon opening than i was about the nomad .
1, the machine is very light and slim and fits nicely into my tv stand . 
0, too costly and not efficient if you ask me !
1, the main issue now is that this new zen micro seems to be the best on the market at least temporarily .
1, i went out and got the canon today .
1, excellent sound - i found the music reproduced faithfully through the jukebox . 
0, i had much of the same problems that everyone else has listed ( mainly the slooooooooow processor )  and then i couldn 't get the damn thing off my computer completely !
0, one more thing  the default ringtones that come with the phone are horrible . 
1, the player has firmware  which will remove the glitches  if there are any . 
1, i just upgraded to the linksys wrt54g wireless-g router last month and i am very happy with the quality of the product .
0, if you do n't have tags  it 'll lump all of your tracks into the same directory and they cannot be searched via artist or album as the zen does not recognize folders . 
0, it is a little cumbersome to scroll through so many levels to get to the selection you want . 
1, operating its many features is easy and often obvious - i 'm no annie lebovitz  but i was able to figure out most of its abilities just messing around with it at a camera store . 
1, transferring files couldn 't be easier thanks to the included software bundle .
0, also  the battery 's aren 't user replaceable .
1, great camera  and for the price you can 't beat it . 
0, the creative zen micro is a zen micro killer  not an ipod killer .
1, it has plenty of power .
1, : ! ok  score 7.0 oh yes  the newest color of this phone is quite cool .
1, 6 the nikon coolpix line is a well-established line so you know support and parts are going to be available even when nikon releases a newer model . 
1, it feels solid and not flimsy like the carbon .
1, the zen xtra sounds great with good headphone and well recored mp3s . 
0, too bad the product is cumbersome and intertwined trying to do so much at one time .
0, basically  i ate the cost of the renewal and ate the cost of the tech help .
0, the only downside i have found with this phone is that it is a bit slow to react  meaning when i push the contacts button  it takes a while to load  this is true for almost all the menus and programs on the phone .
1, the 30gb zen xtra rocks my socks  spills my beer  but does n't wash my car . 
1, the picture is perfect  although i 'm not watching on an hdtv . 
1, i found best results in most situation with manual / center auto focus  manual mode  iso 100 ( shorter aperture-time  so more often sharper images as with iso 50 )  auto white balance ( auto white balance is better than of the other canon cameras i have and they already do very-well ) .
1, features : click wheel to navigate ; ability to work with windows or mac ; optional backlighting ( you can have it on all the time  or have it shut off to save battery power after 5  10  or 20 seconds ) ; ability to download pda info ; automatic or manual download from itunes when ipod is plugged into your computer .
1, i selected the 4300 right away and have gotten high quality pictures every time . 
0, only thing missing from creative is a cd burner . 
1, the cool thing about the ad-2600 it plays alot of different file like mp3  wma cds  jpeg and kodak picture cds  dvd 's  dvd - / + r 's . 
1, i thought i 'd have to buy a set of headphones to use with it  but the included earbuds work quite well . 
1, the extra gb of hardrive space  removeable battery and fm tuner  as well as the fact that i was previously a satisfied owner of the nomad ii put it over the top for me .
1, i also liked the fact that you can save custom playlist you made on the player not just the computer ! 
1, the champ works great .
1, so far i have no complaints and i recommend this to anyone who wants quality over appearance  also anyone who wants a harddrive based mp3 player and wants to pay next to nothing . 
0, after @ 3 months  it stoppped playing higher number scenes on dvds . 
0, too bad they don 't mention anything about how the cd can 't be used with a mac .
0, unfortunately  it does not give you the option of unstalling ( or uninstalling ) them individually .
1, the screen 's large and easily read . 
1, my experience with installation was quite good .
0, so  you might inquire  why don 't they make it a first priority to carefully  simply explain how download music from your music library to their device ? ? ? this seems academic to me .
0, some more manual control would have been nice .
0, again  this doesn 't affect regular mp3 files - just subscription drm-encoded files  like those from napster-to-go or yahoo music unlimited .
0, we tried the " finding nemo " dvd and when we got to ~ chapter 28  the frames started to freeze for no reason . 
1, it does n't smell like burning plastic when you open the drive . 
0, what a junk . 
1, we were able to obtain a norton corporate edition of antivirus only ( no firewall or utilities ) and so far it 's great .
0, the canon software for raw images does not present you with a raw image at all  but the raw image after it has been processed by all the image-affecting settings in the camera . 
1, the supplied headphones are hands-down better than the mediocre ipod buds .
0, unfortunately it can 't play all of the dvd . 
1, i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g3 ( in conjunction with my professional flash system )  and can easily put up with the cameras limitations  because ive never seen anything better within its resolution limits . 
1, mine installed no problem ( but i did uninstall my norton anti-virus 2002 & personal firewall 2002 first ) .
0, one other issue is that the headphone jack is unique to nokia  so standard headphones will not work . 
0, the other pail i used started to smell after 2 weeks of use .
1, - large easy readable screen 
1, longer battery life  greater accessibility to online music services  and pc compatibility are the sensibilities . 
1, night mode is clear as day . 
1, great camera . 
1, all in all  this is the camera for you if you can spare the extra cost in price .
1, it has many great features and very few bad ones . 
1, also  multiple picture feature is very  very fast .
0, i especially like the more commonly used buttons  such as play  pause  and stop  to be larger and conveniently placed .

1, the dvd player is fine . 
0, 2 . you still have to clean the thing ! !

1, while i had the phone  the positive features were : good sound quality and an excellent fm phone and earpiece . 
1, despite a critical start  this phone deserves four stars because it accomplishes what it sets out to do ( which is pretty lofty ) ... does more than most ... does it well ... is dependable .
0, you have to press the buttons hard and frequently i end up pressing enter when i meant to scroll . 
1, without any tweaking at all  if the exposure is accurate  the colors are as realistic as ive ever seen produced by film  and this is a raw image ! 
1, i have no problems with the touch pad ( once the sensitivity is set to low ) and the interface is a breeze to use without even looking at the pdf manual .
0, there is no fm tuner  while there is no fm tuner on the creative zen ( on the micro version of the zen there is a tuner )  the iriver h10-20gb  the rio karma  and the iaudio x5 have fm tuners .
1, but at least youre starting with the most photorealistic images ive ever seen from a camera . 
1, that 's a rare and valuable feature . 
0, it was ( i sold it after a few months ) too expensive for the shots that i got . 
1, we empty ours every day and we have never had an odors from it !
1, i must add to the dismay / delight of readers this phone is simply the most groundbreaking phone mankind has ever held .
1, if i could  i 'd trade-up on my creative muvo2 and snag a zen micro tomorrow .

1, for more than a year  and it is totally reliable .
1, 5.the camera installed on this phone is awesome .
1, this product is amazing and better than the ipod you can get at the same price .
0, first  the sound quality is okay  but ( as at least one other reviewer has mentioned ) the eax can cause audio interference after about 30 minutes . 
0, after a week i tried to load some more songs and delete a few but the auto load didn 't do anything but turn on my player .
1, transfering mp3s are a cinch with the included software .
0, i did it and it was worse the second time around ... unbelievable .
1, one of the best cell phones i have ever used to-date . 
1, the scroll wheel is a big improvement over the ipod touchpad . 
0, the buttons are rather stiff .
0, the biggest red flag for me was the fact that although my cousin 's player was relatively new  it was riddled with scratches .
1, zen allows you to scroll up and down the song list selected on the player . 
1, the speakerphone works better than any speakerphone i 've ever had . 
0, 3 ) the lack of an intermediate resolution setting  as other reviewers have suggested  is a problem  but that problem is meaningless with a larger compactflash memory card
1, i have a tendency to do quite a bit of research before i drop money on a tool and everyone i talked to loved this router .
1, i have over 2000 files in my playlist at the moment and the random does a nice job mixing it up . 
1, it plays just about any format ( check before you buy if it plays yours . ) 
0, i can 't tell you how many times i 've chipped a nail or hurt my fingertips because of the force needed to open it .
1, it plays everything  even vcd 's . 
1, took me a few tries to get use to the navigation  but it 's a very user friendly player imo . 
1, at 128 the songs sound very good .
1, all-in-all  its good enough for its price as long as it doesnt break again due to normal use .

0, when the screen stops working  you 're out of luck !
0, pc cable is too expensive ... $ 50 for a usb cable ? 
0, my only gripe about the hardware is the buttons . 
1, all the buttons & neccessary lil ' gadgets are on the sides of the player which is nice for when you are holding it in the palm of your hand . 
1, when you put this phone in your pocket you forget it is there ; it is unbelievably small and oh  so light . 
1, the battery life is ok  but can be somewhat short when working a lot with the monitor on .

0, i have read the installation instructions for both nis 2004 and nav 2004 prior to installation  but still ended up with the same result ... junk software .
0, the software is not good either and the driver has trouble working with other sound blaster products  which is very dumb . 
0, secondly  in addition to the lag each time you give a command  it 's just not that easily useable on the go .

1, this is by far the finest camera in its price and category i have ever used . 
1, i have no problem using itunes with the zen micro ( in a makeshift sorta way ) .
0, it 's as though nokia has segregated 90 % of the screen for fancy features rarely used and leave just 10 % for the day to day use .
1, i love this pail !
0, there is not a word about satellite issues in either the user guide or the " knowledge " database at linksys.com  and first tech support person i spoke with kept me on the phone for an hour  then gave me a web site address to consult--that turned out to be the one i 'd already found during a search of my own .

1, if i had to do it over again  even with the cost savings of using any type of bag  i would go w / the diaper genie .

0, 1 no direct firewire to the camera . 
0, after 57 pictures total the lcd went black except for the icons showing the settings .
0, the black fly wheel feels pretty cheap & is uncomfortable to use . 
0, 2 ) the body construction - buttons  casing  etc  are too plastic . 
0, to use the creative zen player with a subscription service  you need to go to creative 's web site  and download new software for your pc .
1, it 's not a listed feature but  the one thing that sold the unit is that it plays mpeg video . 
1, on top of being a workhorse and ultra reliable  it is just a plunge router that works really well .
1, this little camera has created a marriage between myself and nikon. never knew i could love a digital camera so much . 
1, i could probably use a trash can and be ok at this point  but this prduct seems to work very well so far .
1, the manual does a fine job filling in any blanks that remain . 
0, the included memory card is too small .

1, it fits comfortably in my shirt pocket and while very well-designed  doesn 't look to ostentatious while i 'm walking around with it .
1, it takes great pictures . 
1, the voice quality is very good  and it gets great reception ( that is  in places where you get t-mobile coverage  which is not that good ; see below ) . 
1, the free ( i didnt know they still did that ) carrying case is really protective  and to me its the only accessory you need ( except good headphones ) . 
0, cons - difficult to open to change bag-twice my bags caught on a sharp edge inside and snagged as i was pulling out-leaving dirty diapers all over the floor .
1, i 've tried the free versions of zone alarm and the free version of sygate and they both have a nice and easy installation and work great ! .
0, when i went to put in the new sd card i looked at the lcd screen -- cracked-- and the fluid gave a jackson pollock type appearance to the screen  black and blue and purple blotches and streaks --useless .
1, this is a benefit for many reasons ; one being just for appearance  your pants wo n't be bulging with this phone in your pocket . 
1, best camera ever . from the image quality  color  function  i can say almost everything . 
1, i quickly got to use to the interface and can find any song / playlist etc fast enough . 
0, 3 . mediasource is an application with serious user interface flaws . 
0, the only main drawback is the fact that the voice-dialing system is kinda picky .

0, a bit dissapoitnd on that !
0, on the downside  i think the interface takes some getting used to and the zen software !
0, this is not an enterprise piece of hardware that you will find in an office or corporate environment .
0, only 1 problem  no accessories ... yet . 
1, compatability with other devices is excellent too ; i 've only found one 11b device that won 't work with its mixed mode ( and it won 't work with * anyone 's * mixed mode ) .
1, it 's easier and much more convenient to use because it doesn 't have clumsy and confusing ( not to mention expensive ) refills .
1, the new router came with an updated setup utility that makes getting the router installed a fairly straight forward process .
1, but  if you 're looking for my opinion of the apex dvd player  i love it ! 
0, other things that i miss are voice-activated dialing and a standard 2.5 mm headset jack . 
1, the phones are awesome . 
1, the player looks great  feels great  and sounds great .
1, the fm tuner is just a little spare icing on the cake .

1, there is also a small covering for the lens  so you need not worry that the lens will get scratched .
0, the battery life can 't be very long ; let 's not be greedy .
1, many have complained about the software included but in my opinion it 's easy to use and effective . 
1, as far as user interface is concerned  the best and easiest to use seems to be the one that comes with the player  ' creative mediasource organizer ' .

1, remember  this phone uses an operating system - symbian ... and it 's feature-rich w / 65k colors .
0, i forgot  the case does n't fit .

1, strong points : - design : small  comfortable  curved  and stylish .

1, whether you 're taking a brisk jog  waiting for a bus or just having lunch at the park  you 'll be glad you had the fm radio . 
0, the lens is visible in the viewfinder when the lens is set to the wide angle  but since i use the lcd most of the time  this is not really much of a bother to me . 
1, it works great  i am usually at the full 54 mbps  although every now and then that drops to around 36 mbps only because i am 2 floors below where the router is .
1, the menus and features are easy to manipulate and access  and it takes silent movies .

1, after getting used to the m12 all the rest seemed lacking .
1, a very well made product that has worked very well for me over the years .
1, i have set up it 's pda features with avantgo.com where you can download info from sites like weather  mapquest maps / directions into it  which is great .

1, otherwise  it takes very good pictures ; shutter delay is n't so bad either . 
1, - outstanding signal reception 
0, it sends discoutinous signals to tv  so the tv has the pictures for one moment and has only the white noise for the other moment . 
0, i 've since replaced it with a pair of black sennheisers ... not only are the packaged earbuds pretty uncomfortable  but are too similar to ipod 's and can target ipod theives here in nyc .
1, all in all this a great player that blows the i-pod away  with easy to use and understand features  software that is simple to understand and use  and a great sound ( which is all that matters in a mp3 player ) . 
0, unfortunately  after loading 280 + songs  all i get now is " player either not connected or busy . " 
0, i found that low light situations combined with any sort of action left this camera in the dust .

1, i am willing to overlook it 's problems to get superior sound quality and low price  although i feel the player has a lot of room for improvement . 
1, canon 's optics are better and i believe their processing algorithms are also better . 
1, long live apple  long live macs  and long live the ipod !
0, battery life is not long enough if and only if you take a lot of video clips and play it back on the camera a lot of times ... the camera / battery gets a little bit warm too when you use it for a long time but it 's normal .

1, with the right firmware  drag and drop to and from the player like any other jump drive .
1, i got a 1gb mmc upgrade for this phone and now i can :
1, another great feature for me anyway is the ability to load .wav sounds as ringers .
0, i see many other reviews that say the same .... stay away from norton  they don 't deserve you  or anyone !
1, but if you want a great deal and a great mp3 player  get the nomad . 
1, this is the best dvd player i 've purchased . 
0, do not buy any home version of norton anything .
1, having usb 2.0 makes for very fast transfers .

0, also  the player sometimes freezes  not a very big problem  but can also be annoying .

0, it took several days of attempts before things finally " worked " again and i have n't a clue why . 
1, i am happy with the fact that i can use any bag in there and dont ' have to pay out the nose for replacements .
0, 4 ) buttons are quite small and is really a pain exp if one is fond of text messaging .
1, the movie mode is also working great . 
0, seemed like a good deal  but this pos frequently cannot recognize dvds and music cds -- takes a long time loading and then concludes  " no disc " . 
0, sure  it 's a little bigger than the ipod  but not by much . 
0, first of all  i 've never been big on earbuds - they 're just not that comfortable .
1, i imagine if i left my player untouched ( no backlight ) it could play for considerably more than 12 hours at a low volume level .
0, on average  indoor shots with a flash are not quite as good as 35mm . 
0, it worked from 12-26 to 1-9 at which time the picture failed completely ( see other negative reviews-my unit was n't the only one this happened to . )
