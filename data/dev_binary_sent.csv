1, for the money  i 'm not sure you can do better .

1, the hands-free speakerphone is quite powerful ( like the motorola phone  i used to own ) . 
0, also  for some reason the picture looks washed out on s-video  with lots of color bleeding  compared to a component connection ( should not be much of a perceptible difference on a 27 " tv ).
